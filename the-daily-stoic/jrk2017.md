## Get active in your own rescue ##

> "Stop wandering about! You aren't likely to read your own notebooks, or
ancient histories, or the anthologies you've collected to enjoy in your old
age.  Get busy with life's purpose, toss aside empty hopes, get active in your
own rescue - if you care for yourself at all - and do it while you can."
--Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 3.14

Reading and studying should have a purpose (to aid the living out of our
personal philosophy [Rohn]), but eventually we need to just take action.
Don't get stuck with another book, just take action.  Focus on projects (action)
over just studying (inaction).  Life is short and could end today or tomorrow.
