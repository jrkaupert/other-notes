# Chapter 12 Notes #
From *Matching Supply with Demand* by Cachon and Terwiesch

## Introduction ##
- matching supply and demand is especially hard when supply has to be chosen in advance of demand and demand is uncertain
- the **newsvendor model** is a tool to help match supply with demand
  - applies to many different settings where firm must decide supply before demand is known
    - long lead times + short product lifecycle is one application: purchase too many components and you may be selling off
    obsolete tech, purchase too few and you may miss out on significant profit (Cisco)

## 12.1 O'Neill Inc. ##
- two selling seasons
  - some products sold both seasons, but most sold in one or the other
  - three month lead time (need to submit orders before the start of the season, in advance of demand)
  - considerable uncertainty in demand
  - after 1-2 months in a season, demand will be more well understood and can be handled as needed
    - no way to deal with stock outs
    - can mark down inventory at end of season if needed

## 12.2 An Introduction to the Newsvendor Model ##
- Newsvendor model considers setting with only one production/procurement opportunity
- entire order received just in time for season to start
- if demand exceeds order quantity, entire order is sold, otherwise, you have leftover inventory
- fixed cost per unit ordered (only depends on number of units ordered)
- leftover inventory at end of season has some value associated with it (salvage value), or none at all, or negative
if there's a disposal cost
- need forecast for demand in order to make a production decision

## 12.3 Constructing a Demand Forecast ##
- newsvendor model balances cost of ordering too much against cost of ordering too little by utilizing demand uncertainty
- need a probability distribution function F(Q), which is the probability the outcome of the random variable is Q or lower
  - discrete distribution functions are given as a table (set of possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities)
  - continuous distribution functions have an unlimited number of possible outcomes, and are defined by parameters related
  to the type of distribution (for example, Exponential or Normal, with parameters such as mu (mean) and sigma (standard deviation))
- A/F ratio = actual demand divided by forecast (describes relative forecast errors)
  - accurate forecasts have A/F = 1
  - expected actual demand = expected A/F ratio * forecast
  - std dev of demand = std dev of A/F ratios * forecast
- assessing a single point forecast is insufficient, we must be able to quantify probabilistic effects when uncertainty exists

## 12.4 Expected Profit-Maximizing Order Quantity ##
- after assessing inputs in terms of selling price, cost, salvage value, and demand forecast, we must choose an order quantity
- an objective must be picked, such as profit-maximization (section 12.6 considers others)
- maximizing expected profit = minimizing costs associated with ordering too much or too little
- Co = overage cost, incurred when units are ordered but not sold
- Cu = underage cost, the opportunity cost incurred by not ordering a unit that could have been sold, or the gain of selling a unit
- overage and underage costs are on a per-unit basis
- Expected loss for having one unit extra in inventory is Co * F(Q)
- Expected gain for selling a unit is Cu * (1 - F(Q))
- to find order quantity where expected loss equals expected gain:
  - Co * F(Q) = Cu * (1-F(Q))
  - or: F(Q) = Cu / (Co + Cu) [critical ratio]
- For finding optimal Q:
  - z = Normsinv(critical ratio)
  - Q = mu + z * sigma
  - always round up when using a table (leading to larger order quantity)
- critical ratio assumes you keep ordering until you get to the first order quantity that the critical ratio is less than
the probability demand is that order quantity or lower

## 12.5 Performance Measures ##
Some performance measures to evaluate order quantities:
- Expected Lost Sales = number of units by which demand exceeds order quantity (measured in units, not dollars)
  - average of possibilities of demand being less than or greater than the order quantity
  - Given by Expected Lost Sales = sigma * L(z)
    - sigma = std dev of normal distribution of the demand
    - L(z) = loss function with standard normal distribution
    - z = (Q - mu) / sigma
    - L(z) = Normdist(z, 0, 1, 0) - z * (1 - Normsdist(z))
- Expected Sales
  - Expected sales = mu - Expected lost sales
- Expected Leftover Inventory = average amount that demand is less than order quantity
  - Expected leftover inventory = Q - Expected Sales
  - while actual leftover inventory and actual lost sales cannot be both positive in a season, expected leftover inventory and 
  expected lost sales can be, because they are expectations
- Expected Profit
  - Expected profit = [(price - cost) * expected sales] - [(cost - salvage value) * expected leftover inventory]
- in-stock and stockout probability
  - in-stock probability = F(Q) [Probability that all demand in a season satisfied]
  - Stockout probability - 1 - F(Q) [Probability that all demand in a season is NOT satisfied]
- fill rate = probability a customer is able to purchase a unit (alternative measure to stockout)

## 12.6 Choosing Order Quantity to Meet Service Objective ##
- expected profit is not the only objective to optimize when considering an order quantity
- maximizing order quantity may product undesired in-stock probabilities from a customer service perspective
- In-stock probability = F(Q) [Find order quantity such that there is 99% prob that demand is that quantity or lower]
- z = Normsinv(in-stock probability)
- substantially higher order quantity may be required to handle a certain service level compared to maximizing expected profit

## 12.7 Managerial Lessons ##
3 key lessons for forecasting:
1. Forecast of expected demand by product is insufficient - also need forecast for how variable that demand might be,
which is captured by the standard deviation of demand
2. Tracking actual demand is important
  - actual demand may be greater than sales (if you have an inventory shortage)
  - actual demand includes potential sales only at regular price (clearance price doesn't give an accurate picture)
3. Past forecasts and forecast errors need to be tracked to assess standard deviation in the demand
  - difficult to choose accurate standard deviations without past data from forecasts and actuals

Lessons from order quantity choice process:
1. profit-maximizing order quantity typically does not equal demand
  - if underage cost is greater than overage cost, profit-maximizing order quantity is larger than expected demand 
  (critical ratio > 0.5)
  - If overage cost greater than underage cost, best order quantity is less than expected demand
2. order quantity decision should be separate from forecasting
  - goal of forecasting is to find best forecast for product's demand without regard to the order quantity decision
3. Explicit costs should not be prioritized over opportunity costs
  - inventory at end of season is explicit cost of supply-demand mismatch
  - lost sales are the opportunity cost
  - emphasizing explicit costs over opportunity costs will lead to less profit due to suboptimal order quantity
4. Maximizing profit is only one objective of choosing an order quantity
  - If variability of profit matters, ordering less than profit-maximizing quantity makes sense
  - customer service is not factored into profit-maximization scenario, but may also be a key factor if stockouts are 
  undesirable
5. perfectly matching supply with demand when supply must be chosen in advance of uncertain demand is impossible, but
smart choices can be made to balance ordering too much against ordering too little
  - uncertainty should not justify ad hoc decision making!

## 12.8 Summary ##
- Newsvendor model = tool for making decisions when there is possibility of both ordering too much or too little
  - costs associated with having too much (leftover inventory), as well as too little (lost sales opportunity cost)
- Need complete forecast of demand in order to predict
- With a forecast, can choose the quantity to maximize expected profit or achieve desired in-stock probability
- can evaluate performance measures such as expected sales and expected profit

Key Notation
- Q = order quantity
- Cu = Underage cost
- Co = Overage cost
- Critical Ratio = Cu / (Cu + Co)
- mu = expected demand
- sigma = standard deviation of demand
- F(Q) = distribution function
- Phi(Q) = distribution function of the standard normal

Key Equations
- Expected actual demand = Expected A/F Ratio * Forecast
- Standard deviation of actual demand = Standard Deviation of A/F Ratios * Forecast
- Expected Profit-Maximizing Order Quantity: F(Q) = Cu / (Cu + Co)
- z-statistic or normalized order quantity: z = (Q - mu) / sigma
  - alternatively: Q = mu + z * sigma
- L(z) = expected lost sales with standard normal distribution
- Expected Lost Sales = sigma * L(z)
- Expected Sales = mu - Expected Lost Sales
- In Excel: Expected Lost Sales = sigma * (Normdist(z, 0, 1, 0) - z * (1 - Normdist(z)))
- Expected Leftover Inventory = Q - Expected Sales
- Expected Profit = [(Price - Cost) * Expected Sales] - [(Cost - Salvage Value) * Expected Leftover Inventory]
- In-stock Probability = F(Q)
- Stock-out Probability = 1 - In-stock probability
- In Excel: z = Normsinv(Target In-Stock Probability)
- In Excel: In-stock probability = Normsdist(z)
