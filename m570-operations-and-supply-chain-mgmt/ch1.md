From *Matching Supply with Demand* by Cachon and Terwiesch

## Introduction ##
Economics pretends that prices adjust to match supply with demand, but managers
have a more difficult reality.
- Excess demand = lost revenue
- Excess supply = wasted resources

Matching supply to demand is the focus of the book, and allows firms to gain
competitive advantage over competitors

Sometimes price adjustment does happen to help match supply with demand, but
usually it's not under firm control, and often times it's impossible.

**Why is matching supply with demand difficult?**
- Demand is variable in predictable or unpredictable ways
- Supply is inflexible

Effective operations management is about effectively matching supply with demand

Operations management tools can be applied in various ways:
1. Ensure resources used efficiently
2. Make trade-offs between competing objectives
3. Redesign/restructure operations to improve performance in multiple dimensions
at the same time

Good companies try to operate on the efficiency frontier.  Great companies try
to move the frontier beyond what was previously possible.
