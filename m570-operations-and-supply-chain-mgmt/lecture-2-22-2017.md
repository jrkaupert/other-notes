## ALKO Case ##
- transportation costs are not fixed
- periodic review of inventory
- Pooling = bringing random variables together
  - Can have a big warehouse to centrally serve distribution needs

**Safety Inventory** is connected to standard deviation

Different means to achieve risk pooling:
- Aggregate demand **across customers/markets**
  - Inventory aggregation (Centralized system) where you serve your markets
  through a centralized production/distribution system
- Aggregate demand **across products**
  - Modularity / component commonality / universal products
  - utilize similar raw materials or subassy's across products
  - benefits:
    - parallel processing -> reduced lead times
    - risk pooling -> reduced inventory cost/higher service levels
    - fewer components -> reduced inventory handling / procurement costs
- Aggregate demand **across time**
  - product differentiation postponement
  - design product & mfg processes so that decisions about specific products can
  be delayed as late as possible
    - manufacture a generic product first, then differentiate to make specific
    products
    - can reorder sequence of steps to differentiate at last possible moment
    (ie: dying clothes a specific color)
    - benefit: reduced uncertainty in demand and inventory

  Coefficient of Variation = std dev / mean = relative variability measure.
  Helps us make comparisons between products
  - CV >=1 means huge variability
  - let CV drive decisions about centralization (don't have to centralize
  everything)

  C.R.I.M = continuous review inventory management
  - E(DL) = E(D) * L
  - sigma(DL) = sqrt(L) * E(D)
  - Need to keep LESS safety stock compared to periodic review
  - SS = k*sigma(DL)

  P.R.I.M = periodic review inventory management
  - E(DL+T) = E(D) * (L+T)
  - sigma(DL+T) = sqrt(L+T) * E(D)
  - Need to keep more safety stock compared to CRIM
  - SS = k*sigma(DL+T)

  k = normsinv(0.95)

  Stock for combined demands is usually less than combined stocks due to
  aggregation

  The higher the Cycle service level, the more the savings
