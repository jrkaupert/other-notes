## Economic Consequences of Supply/Demand Mismatch ##

### Air Travel ###
Issue is how to manage fixed supply.
- **Supply:** Seats on specific flight
- **Demand:** Travel for specific time and destination
- **Supply Exceeds Demand:** Empty Seat
- **Demand Exceeds Supply:** Overbooking; customer must take different
flight (profit loss)
- **Actions to match S&D:** Dynamic pricing, booking policies
- **Managerial Importance:** About 30% of all seats fly empty; a 1-2%
increase in seat utilization makes difference between profit and losses

### Emergency Rooms ###
- **Supply:** Medical Service
- **Demand:** Urgent need for medical service
- **Supply Exceeds Demand:** Doctors, nurses, infrastructure under-utilized
- **Demand Exceeds Supply:** Crowding, delays, potential diversion of
ambulances
- **Actions to match S&D:** Staffing to predicted demands, priorities
- **Managerial Importance:** Delays in treatment or transfer have been linked
to death

### Retailing ###
- **Supply:** Consumer electronics
- **Demand:** Consumers buying a new video system
- **Supply Exceeds Demand:** High inventory costs; few inventory turns
- **Demand Exceeds Supply:** Foregone profit opportunity; consumer
dissatisfaction
- **Actions to match S&D:** Forecasting, quick response
- **Managerial Importance:** Per unit inventory costs per consumer
electronics retailing commonly exceed net profits

### Iron Ore Plant ###
- **Supply:** Iron ore
- **Demand:** steel mills
- **Supply Exceeds Demand:** prices fall
- **Demand Exceeds Supply:** prices rise
- **Actions to match S&D:** If prices fall too low, production facility is
shut down
- **Managerial Importance:** Prices are so competitive that primary emphasis
is on reducing cost of the supply

### Pacemakers ###
- **Supply:** Medical equipment
- **Demand:** Heart surgeon requires pacemaker at exact time and location
- **Supply Exceeds Demand:** Pacemaker sits in inventory
- **Demand Exceeds Supply:** Forgone profit (typically not associated with
  medical risk)
- **Actions to match S&D:** Distribution systems holding pacemakers at
various locations
- **Managerial Importance:** Most products (valued $20k) spend 4-5 months
waiting in a trunk of a sales person before being used
