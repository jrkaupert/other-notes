# Notes on the Engineering Method and Heuristics #

Billy V. Koen is a mechanical engineering professor at UT Austin promoting
a theory that engineering heuristics generalize to the engineering method
which generalize to the universal method.

His book *Discussion of the Method* (2003) identifies the long sought after
"universal method" as being the same as the engineering method of using
heuristics to solve problems that are too complex, too poorly understood, and
that would require too much in the way of limited resources to solve directly.
