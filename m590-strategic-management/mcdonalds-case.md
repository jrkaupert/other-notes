# McDonalds Case #
From Strategic Management book by Dess, McNamara, & Eisner

## Possible Problems ##
What are the problems?
- poor financial performance
- loss of customers, especially milennials, to other similar chains as
well as non-burger chains
- expanded menu in response to competition is more expensive and adds prep
time (moved away from some of its core values)
- appealing to health concerns
- new business model pilots creating more expensive menu items that take
more time to create
- dollar menu changes
- trying too much without a real strategy
- not clear what consumers want out of the chain
- lowest rank of food quality across chains
- image problem in America
- bulk of sales come from 5 items despite huge menu size
- trying to be everything to everyone
- who is the company actually competing with? Burger chains? Other types?

What are the strategic issues?
- Organizational goals and objectives
  - Does McDonalds actually know what objectives to focus on, and are these
  consistent with the vision/mission? Are they aligned with it?
  - What stakeholders are most important, if any? Are there any that aren't
  being considered that might be key here?

- External Environment
  - Are there general environment issues at play?
    - milennial trends
    - health trends
    - other?
  - Who is the competition?
    - Traditional burger chains (Wendy's, Burger King, etc...)
    - Designer chains (Five Guys, Shake Shack)
    - Coffee shops (Starbucks)
    - Breakfast restaurants?
    - Other?
  - Are there any other companies "doing things right" that McDonalds could
  look to do better than?
  - Are there specific competitive forces at play that aren't being managed?
    - threat from rivals (possibly new entrants)
    - threat from substitution
    - buyer power? lots of choice in fast food options
    - supplier power?

- Internal environment
  - any weak points in the value chain?
    - marketing - not clear who is the target, trying to serve too many at
    once, image problem in America, not sure what consumers want from the
    brand
    - operations / outbound logistics / service?
      - new menu options taking more time to prep
      - food quality

- business-level strategies

- corporate-level strategies

- international-level strategies
  - is the problem an America-only problem or is focus needed worldwide?

## Key Issue ##

## Alternative Solutions ##
For each solution:

- How does it affect the bottom line?
- Will the employees accept the changes?
- How will changes affect morale?
- How will the decision affect other stakeholders; will customers, suppliers,
and others buy-in?
- How does the solution fit with vision, mission, and objectives?

change?
