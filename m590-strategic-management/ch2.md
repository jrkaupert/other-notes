# Chapter 2 Notes #
Notes taken from *Strategic Management* by Dess, McNamara, and Eisner

Firms must identify opportunities and threats in the external environment in
addition to internal operations.  Misreading the market can be very bad.

All managers have biases, assumptions, and presuppositions about the structure
of their industries, how money is made in the industry, who competition and
customers are, etc...(*Competing for the Future* by Hamel and Prahalad)

Drucker calls these assumptions the "Theory of business". These
assumptions must be constantly questioned

> "Beware of past performance 'proofs'" -- Warren Buffet

**perceptual acuity** = ability to sense what is coming before the fog clears.
Best improved by meeting with other people constantly and looking for info

Processes for developing forecasts:
- Scanning
- Monitoring
- Gathering Competitive Intelligence

**Environmental Scanning** = Surveillance of a firm's external environment to
predict changes and detect changes already occurring.  Allow a firm to plan and
prepare instead of react to changes.  Leading firms can also indicate emerging
trends, ie: Proctor and Gamble products may indicate increased discretionary
spending if cosmetics sales increasing

**Environmental Monitoring** = Firm's analysis of external environment to track
the evoltion of environmental trends, sequences of events, or streams of
activities.  May include examining indices together such as number of rooms in
the budget segment of hotel industry and difference of average daily rate of
rooms and the consumer price index (Motel 6)

**Competitive Intelligence** = Firm's activities of collecting and interpreting
data on competitors, defining and understanding the industry, and identifying
competitor's strengths and weaknesses.  Helps a firm anticipate competitor's
moves to decrease response time

Some sites used for competitive intelligence:
- Slideshare - marketing presentations
- Quora - Q&A on technical questions
- Ispionage - Ad words used being bought
- YouTube - interviews with executives at trade shows

**Environmental Forecasting** = The development of plausible projections about
the direction, scope, speed, and intensity of environmental change.  May ask
questions like:
- How long will it take a new technology to reach the marketplace?
- Will the present social concern about an issue result in new legislation?
- Are current lifestyle trends likely to continue?

Forecasting may cause managers to view predictions as black and white and to
ignore some gray areas.  Underestimating uncertainty produces strategies that
are ineffective against threats and insufficient to exploit opportunities

**Scenario Analysis** = in-depth approach to forecasting that involves expert
detailed assessments of societal trends, economics, politics, technology, or
other dimensions of the external environment.  Involves projection of future
events but does not extrapolate historical trends.  Several scenarios are
considered to identify possible future outcomes

**SWOT analysis** = A framework for analyzing a company's internal and external
environments with respect to strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
- Strengths / Weaknesses deal with internal company environment, where company
excels or may be lacking compared to competitors
- Opportunities / Threats deal with external environment and could be the
general or competitive environment
- In general SWOT analysis leads to a strategy to:
  - Build on strengths
  - Mitigate weaknesses or work around them
  - Exploit opportunities available in the environment
  - Defend against threats

Strengths of SWOT Analysis approach:
1. forces managers to look at both internal and external issues together
2. Focuses the firm on acting proactively rather than reactively
3. Improves the connection in the strategy between the environment and the
strengths and weaknesses of the firm
4. It's simple but also sufficiently rigorous to be useful

Analysis is important, but intuition and judgment are too (think Steve Jobs)

## The General Environment ##
**general environment** = factors external to an industry and usually beyond
the control of a firm that affect a firm's strategy.  Six segments:
1. Demographic
2. Sociocultural
3. Political/legal
4. Technological
5. Economic
6. Global
