# Notes from Enron Case #
From Dess, McNamara, & Eisner *Strategic Management*

- In 2001, Jeffrey Skilling was elected CEO of Enron
- Moving into deregulated energy markets
- In Sept 2000, stock price was $85-$90, by November 2001, <$1
- Various Enron individuals plead guilty to various conspiracies, and some
committed suicide

## From Pipelines to Commodity Trader ##
- Kenneth Lay named CEO of Houston Natural Gas in 1984 to avoid a takeover
- Lay merged HNG with InterNorth and others to form Enron in 1986, took company
international
- Enron ranked 1st in pipelines category in 1994, and was 39th most admired
company in America
- In the 90's, expanded business into other markets such as energy generation,
broadband, and financial markets, while maintaining lead in pipelines
- all the leading ratings dropped after the company's decline, to last place

## "Get it Done. Get it down now. Reap the rewards." ##
- Lay built management of mostly MBAs instead of gas/energy pros
- Enron became derivatives trading company
- creativity and human capital viewed as growth resources for the future
- Extravagance was encouraged
- stock price and Peer Review Committee (PRC) were all that mattered to the
company
  - Legal dept: "We do big, complex, and risky deals without blowing up Enron"
  - employees incentivized by earnings quickly booked, without regard to
  long-term consequences
- high reward structure, similar to other dot-com era companies
- Every 6 months, employees provided feedback on other employees
  - lowest 15% had to be "redeployed", finding another job in the org or
  elsewhere
- analysts with questions on quarterly earnings calls ridiculed if details were
questioned

## Enron and the Capital Markets ##
- Skilling had been a McKinsey & Co. consultant before Enron
- Enron became market maker for natural gas in 1990, and Skilling was hired by
Lay as CEO of Enron Gas Services.  Andy Fastow hired as CFO under Skilling.
Enron Gas Services eventually renamed as Enron Capital and Trade Resources (ECT)
- ECT did financial and risk management services for Enron and trading partners
  - asset securitization services, which made Enron's natural gas and oil
  groups more profitable
  - positioned Enron as market maker for various commodities

### Two Critical Elements: Mark-to-Market and the SPEs ###
- Mark-to-Market = method to aid investors in valuing a security, based on
assumptions.  Used by Enron to establish prices for new commodities when
reference prices didn't exist (ie: for weather)
- Special-purpose entities (SPEs) = financial mechanisms to provide flexibility
for finance and risk management.  Allowed Enron to move debt from its balance
sheet on a continuing basis so it could keep high credit ratings
- "Outside Equity" was provided by "friends of Enron"
- Over 3000 SPEs created to keep debt off the balance sheet
- Only way to more profits was to open new commodity markets, quickly exploit
them, then repeat
- Stock price soared as a result of no debt accumulating on Enron, instead
being held by the SPEs
- SPEs hid debt and losses as revenue, but did not create cash flow for the
company

### The Investment Bank Connection ###
- The need for a high credit rating meant investment banks provided short-term
deals that let loans look like sales revenue, allowing Enron to briefly remove
unprofitable elements from balance sheet

## The Enron Control System ##
- Significant checks existed to examine all deals by the company
- many authorizations left incomplete
- Code of Ethics waived by the board for LJM entity setup
- The board relied on two assumptions for LJM setup
  - each division would aggressively market its assets
  - Andersen's counsel on LJM deals would be independent
- Skilling did not sign many LJM transaction forms
- Stockholders and analysts found it difficult to monitor Enron's position
  - SPEs difficult to find information on
  - many proxy statements and footnotes used
  - details often omitted

## Three International Deals ##
1. Dabhol, India power plant
2. Cuiaba, Brazil gas-fired power generation plant
3. Azurix water company acquisitions

### It Comes Undone ###
- On August 14, 2001, Skilling resigned 6 months after becoming CEO
- Nonderivatives business was losing money, profits were coming from derivatives
- Andersen noted in August 2001 that the Raptor restructurings were not properly
accounted for, and needed to be revised
  - Lay announced $1.2B reduction to S/E
  - Enron consolidated SPEs back to 1997, putting the balance sheets of SPEs
  onto Enron's
- Class-action suit filed against Enron on behalf of shareholders in Oct 2001
- Enron hoped to merge with Dynegy, another energy competitor, but failed
due to fear of what hadn't been disclosed
- Lay resigned Jan 23, 2002

## The Aftershocks ##

### Criminal Actions ###
- congressional hearings occurred, various people charged
  - Fastow, Sklling, Causey, Lay

### The Retirement Vanishes ###
- Enron had been a big part of many retirement funds, especially pensions
- Enron employees were mostly invested in Enron stock, and could not sell
shares until age 55
- substantial losses to pension funds of every state

### The Accounting Profession ###
- Arthur Andersen firm stripped of ability to audit public corporations in the
US, and ceased to do business
- SOX aimed at the conflict of interest between consulting and auditing

### The Charity Fallout ###
"Enron bill" passed by US House of Representatives for disclosure of certain
contributions and gifts to organizations affiliated with board members
