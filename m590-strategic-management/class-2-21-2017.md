What are your strengths/weaknesses?

## Southwest Airlines Case ##
And starting with Maslow's again...
- most companies make it up to Belonging, but not self-esteem or
self-actualization
  - belonging = feel like you fit in
  - self-esteem = proud to work there
  - self-actualization = belief in the company to the point of being willing
  to go above and beyond

  Southwest had to go above and beyond when they first started, and after
  Sept 11th, 2001.
    - Delta lawsuit at start of the company (Allegient airlines exists as
      a result of this lawsuit)
    - Delta did not want SWA to use Love Field
      - no technical reasons, just didn't want lower landing fees from a smaller
      airport for their competitors
      - employees had to fight the David & Goliath fight: underdog, warrior
      culture, under-recognized culture resulted
      - underdog culture is very powerful, don't underestimate it

    - Wild Turkey whiskey, biker jacket CEO
      - sends message that everyone is equal, don't be a stiff in a 3 piece suit
      - genuineness, relatable to employees
        - be you, don't worry about being perfect, just be you
    - most unionized
    - no furloughs

Cost Advantage (What's driving that / who is driving it?)
- employees are driving the advantage
  - working directly with customers
  - employees trust the company, especially early on
  - loyalty
  - "family" culture
  - the vision is REAL (not just a nice, wordsmithed statement)

  CEO James Parker changed culture with a single action
  - strained labor relations
  - Herb Kelleher gave the union workers MORE than they wanted (they walked
    away smiling) in order to fix the relationship

- You don't lay off family.  If your employees are family, you don't lay them
  off!
    - companies that lay people off do worse long-term (according to studies)
    - people are assets.  You don't just sell off a machine that runs out
    of work for a month
    - the no furlough policy is a BIG deal
- SouthWest hires for Attitude.  Attitude is everything
  - Experience isn't always beneficial.  The right attitude is always beneficial
  since experience can be trained
- Herb and VP: Herb pays more attention to gate agents than to the VP
- Supply and demand dictates who gets paid more, but everyone is equal as a
person (Kelleher understood this, makes him relatable)
- Air travel started becoming a commodity in the early 70s, about when Southwest
came in (as market changed from growth to maturity - opening for entry)


5 Forces

          E (l)
          |
Spl (m) - R (h) - B (l)
          |
          S (m-h for most airlines, but SWA able to compete w/ direct flights)

Strong tendencies for companies to focus on the short-term money game, but
this is VERY damaging

## Enron Case ##
Strong Culture
- strip club -> screening mechanism to maintain culture
- cohesive culture
- visible peer reviews (removing dissenters)
- 360 reviews
- hire MBAs
- intensive interviews
- short-term thinking
- all factors leading to military-like, very strong culuture (not necessarily a bad thing!)
- board members

Strong Rewards
- high
- immediate

Weak Boundaries
- policies on paper
- pre-printed forms

3 Levers model (Culture, Rewards, Boundaries)
- everything must be in balance in this model for behavioral control
compared to a traditional approach that emphasizes comparing outcomes to predetermined strategies and fixed rules

Governance controls:
Internal
- executives
- management
- board of directors
- shareholders (investors)

External
- Market for corporate control
- Auditors
- Banks & analysts
- Regulatory bodies
- Media
