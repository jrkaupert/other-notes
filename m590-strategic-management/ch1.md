# Chapter 1 Notes #
Notes taken from *Strategic Management* by Dess, McNamara, and Eisner

## Learning from Mistakes ##
Firms can face difficulties if they do not roll with changes in their
external environment.

**romantic view of leadership** = the leader is the dominant force driving
the success / failure of the organization

**external control view of leadership** = the external factors that the firm's
leader has little control over drive the organization's success / failure

Managers must focus on more than incremental improvements to the firm.  They
must anticipate change proactively and be prepared to change the firm's
direction

## What is Strategic Management? ##
**Strategic Management** = analyses, decisions, and actions a firm does to
develop and maintain competitive advantages
  - Analysis of strategic goals, including mission, vision, and strategic
  objectives and external/internal environments must be done
  - Decisions must be made toward two areas:
    1. Where do we compete?
    2. How do we compete in those industries?
  - Actions must be taken to implement the decisions

**Strategy** = ideas, decisions, and actions that allow an organization to
succeed.  Resources must be assigned and organizational structures designed
to promote success.

Managers must ask:
1. How should we compete to create competitive advantage in the marketplace?
  - Low cost?
  - Unique products/services?
  - Combination?
2. How can we create competitive advantages that are unique, valuable, and
difficult to copy/substitute?

**Competitive Advantage** = Firm's resources & capabilities that allow it to
overcome competitive forces in the marketplace

**Operational Effectiveness** = A firm's ability to do similar activities
better than rivals.  Include various management innovations such as total
quality, JIT, benchmarking, business process reengineering, outsourcing

**Sustainable competitive advantage cannot happen through operational
effectiveness alone because everyone is doing them**

Strategy requires being different.  Copying rivals leads to mutually destructive
price competition, not sustainable competitive advantage

### Four Key Attributes of Strategic Management ###
1. Directed toward overall goals and objectives of the firm
  - Cannot focus on individual functional areas in isolation
2. Includes multiple stakeholders in decision making
  - Cannot focus on individual stakeholders in isolation
3. Incorporates both short-term and long-term perspectives
  - Must be a *creative tension* between the vision for the future and the
  current operating needs
  - Many orgs are too short-term focused to the detriment of long-term success
4. Involves recognition of trade-offs between effectiveness & efficiency

**Stakeholders** = individuals, groups, and firms that have a "stake" in the
success of the organization.  Includes owners/shareholders, employees, customers
suppliers, the community, etc...

**effectiveness** = doing the right things; doing stuff according to the needs
of the organization

**efficiency** = doing things right; doing things at a low cost relative to
a benchmark

**ambidexterity** = ability for a manager to explore new opportunities
proactively while also aligning resources to exploit existing markets

## The Strategic Management Process ##
**Strategic Management Process** = Strategy analysis, Strategy Formulation, &
Strategy Implementation

The actual strategic management process doesn't actually follow linearly from
analysis to formulation to implementation, but is affected by the environment
and politics.

**Intended Strategy** = strategy in which firm's decisions are made by only
analysis

**Realized Strategy** = strategy in which firm's decisions made by both analysis
and unforeseen environmental changes, unexpected resource constraints, and/or
changes in managerial priorities.  Any combination of deliberate and emergent
strategies

**Strategy Analysis** = the study of a firm's external and internal environments
and fit with vision and goals

**Strategy Formulation** = decisions made by firms dealing with investments,
commitments, and areas of operations that develop and maintain competitive
advantage

**Strategy Implementation** = actions by firms that carry out the formulated
strategy, including strategic controls, organizational design, and leadership

## The Roles of Corporate Governance and Stakeholder Management ##
**Corporate Governance** = relationship among various participants in
determining the direction and performance of corporations.  Primary participants
include:
  1. shareholders
  2. management, led by the CEO
  3. board of directors

**Stakeholder management** = firm's strategy for recognizing and responding to
the interests of important stakeholders.  Two ways to look at it:
  1. Zero sum = stakeholders compete for resources in the organization, with
  one's gain being another's loss
  2. Symbiosis = Stakeholders are dependent on each other for success

Stakeholder's Claims in an Organization:
- Stockholders - Dividends, capital appreciation
- Employees - Wages, benefits, safe working environment, job security
- Suppliers - Payment on time, assurance of continued relationship
- Creditors - Payment of interest, repayment of principal
- Customers - Value, warranties
- Government - Taxes, compliance with regulations
- Communities - Good citizenship such as charity, employement, not polluting

**Social Responsibility** = expectation that businesses or individuals will
work to improve the overall welfare of society

**Triple Bottom Line Approach** = evaluating a firm's performance based on
financial, social, and environmental performance

Sustainability initiatives don't necessarily drag on a business, but many
businesses have a hard time approving them due to business processes and
desire for ROI.  ROI is hard to determine for sustainability projects because:
  1. Data necessary to calculate is inaccurate or unavailable
  2. Many benefits from such projects intangible
  3. Payback period is on a different time frame than traditional projects

## Strategic Management Perspective: An Imperative Throughout the Firm ##
Strategic management must be undertaken with an integrative view of the firm so
that all functional areas and activities may be fit together to help the firm
achieve its goals and objectives

Leaders are needed throughout the organization:
1. **Local line leaders** - have profit and loss responsibility
2. **Executive leaders** - Champion and guide ideas, create learning systems,
and promote taking action
3. **Internal Networkers** - little actual power or authority, but create power
via conviction and clarity of ideas

Top execs set the tone for the organization to empower employees

Major changes in communication, incentives, training, and development may be
required to transform an organization

## Ensuring Coherence in Strategic Direction ##
Employees and managers must work together toward the firm's goals and objectives

It is necessary for everyone to understand the desired results

**Hierarchy of goals** = Organizational goals, ranging from ones at the top that
are less specific but evoke powerful mental images, to specific, measurable
goals at the bottom.  Visions have long time horizons compared to mission
statements or strategic objectives

**Organizational vision** = a firm's goal(s) that evoke powerful and compelling
mental images for employees.  Must be developed and implemented by leaders

Organizational visions issues:
1. The management's behavior isn't consistent with the vision
2. The vision is irrelevant to reality
3. If it is viewed as the "holy grail" that will cure firm problems
4. If it fails, it can be devastating for the firm
5. It can be an ideal future mismatched with the current present reality

**Mission Statements** = set of organizational goals that include the purpose
of the organization, its scope of operations, and the basis of its competitive
advantage.  Must communicate why a firm is special and different.  Profit is
usually not mentioned (it's like oxygen, food, or water - you gotta have it)

**Strategic Objectives** = set of organizational goals that are used to
operationalize the mission statement.  
  - Specific and cover a well-defined timeframe
  - These focus employee efforts toward a common goal, and identify where
  resources should be spent
  - May inspire employees to work harder than if the goal is simply to "do your
  best"
  - Focuses all parts of the organization toward common goals instead of toward
  individual group goals
  - Provide a way to measure towards rewards and incentives
  - Too many can result in lack of focus, leading to worse results
