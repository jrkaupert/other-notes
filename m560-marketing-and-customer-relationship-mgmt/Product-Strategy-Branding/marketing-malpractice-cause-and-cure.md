# Notes from *Marketing Malpratice: The Cause and the Cure* #
by Clayton M. Christensen, Scott Cook, and Taddy Hall

## Summary ##
### Idea in Brief ###
- over 30,000 new products are launched annually, but 90% fail
- poor market segmentation is to blame
  - we look at representative customers in a segment and pretend that everyone
  will act on average like that
  - in reality, people don't, so we develop products that don't meet their needs
- a better way is to find out what jobs people want or need to get done
  - then develop **purpose brands**, products or services consumers can "hire",
  thus doing the job for them
- clear purpose brands:
  1. guide customers to the right products
  2. guide marketing teams to create and market new products and improvements
- payoff: customers value your products and brands, leading to profit growth
that can be sustained over time

### Idea in Practice ###
- Observe consumers in action
  - observe and interview people as they're using products in order to figure
  out what jobs they want to get done
  - identify new or improved offerings that could help them do their job better
- link products to jobs through advertising
  - let advertising make the job the product performs for the customer clear
  - name the product in a way that helps improve awareness of its purpose
  - good ads can identify needs for consumers they didn't even know about before
- extend the purpose brand
  - make different products that do different jobs, rather than having a product
  that does a bunch of jobs
  - create purpose brands for new, but related jobs

## Introduction ##
- traditional methods of segmentation, brand-building, and understanding
customers are broken
- building brands = attaching brands to products that matter to customers
- need to segment based on how people actually live

## Broken Paradigms of Market Segmentation ##
- solve the problem customers need, not a bunch of problems they don't have by
adding useless features
- don't push customers into arbitrary segments based on demographics, etc...
  - customers don't match the average consumer in their segment, so the
  likelihood of buying can only be expressed stochastically
  - traditional methods taught in business schools are actually one of the
  reasons new products are such a gamble
- markets are simple from a customer's perspective: they need to get certain
things done
  - marketers need to figure out what jobs a customer needs done and then
  create products that do the job, and emphasize its intended use via ads
- making a product that's easier and cheaper to complete jobs a customer doesn't
do or doesn't do often makes it less likely to be a success

## Designing Products that Do the Job ##
- most jobs people need to be done have social, functional, and emotional
dimensions
  - understanding these dimensions allow marketers to target products
  effectively
- job-defined markets may be much larger than product category-defined markets
as they may also cover substitutes way more effectively
  - looking at market segmentation as product category basically ignore
  substitutes

## How a Job Focus Can Grow Product Categories ##
- growth markets can be created when products are designed and positioned on
they job they do when no other product effectively serves that need
- observe people!
- customers may not even realize that a product will do the job they need if
the product isn't focused on that job, even if one exists that could do it
  - products that do many jobs can fall into this trap
  - should split products into multiple lines, each more focused

## Building Brands That Customers Will Hire ##
- sometimes customers know they need to job done, but other times, customers
aren't even aware of it (may be ingrained in routine)
- ideally, a branded product will exist that will perfectly handle the job
when they realize they need the job done
- A **purpose brand** is a brand that is strongly linked to the job it's
supposed to accomplish
  - when a product does its job and customers talk about it, brand equity is
  built
  - brand equity can be reduced or eliminated when brands are not tied to a
  purpose, however
  - purpose brands identify which features/functions matter for the job, and
  which other enhancements are irrelevant
  - price premiums for the brand are the wage paid by customers to know they
  have the right product with the right features for the job
  - sometimes the need to feel a specific way is a job as well
    - aspirational jobs / situations (wanting to feel macho, pampered,
      prestigious) - the brand does more of the heavy lifting than the actual
      product functions in getting the job done

## Purpose Brands and Disruptive Innovations ##
- disruptive innovations can create growth without destroying brand value as
long as there's a unique brand purpose
- quality can only be measured relative to the job that needs to be done and
the alternatives that are available to do it

## The Role of Advertising ##
- advertising alone cannot build brands, but it informs people about how
and existing branded product does the job well
- advertising can clarify what the job is and how the product does it for
consumers
  - advertising cannot replace designing products that do specific jobs and
  making sure a product's features/functions are relevant to the job
- brand building via advertising is crazy expensive, and is the wrong way to
build a brand

## Extending - Or Destroying - Brand Equity ##
- strong brand purpose often leads to people in companies wanting to extend
the brand to other products, but this should be carefully reviewed
  - if the brand is extended onto products that do the same job, the brand
  will not be compromised
  - extending a purpose brand onto a different job will muddy the meaning
  of the brand, however, and turn it into an **endorser brand**, which still
  provides value, but causes the brand to be unable to help people find the
  right product for the job they need accomplished
    - corresponding bad experience from customers using products that don't
    do the job they need hurts brand reputation
    - need to use a second purpose brand along with the endorser brand in order
    to avoid this fate
- clear purpose brands may actually be even better than having a superior
product offering - performance is much easier to copy than purpose branding
- ways to extend brands without destroying them:
  1. develop different products that address a common job
  2. find new, related jobs, and create purpose brands that benefit from the
  "endorser" impact of the original purpose brand

## Why Strong Purpose Brands Are So Rare ##
- despite the potential power of purpose brands, they are extremely rare in
practice because most companies don't focus on creating them
- focusing product and brand toward a job creates differentiation
  - by differentiating, the company also points out what jobs the product does
  not do, and that's ok!
  - better than creating vague brands with no meaning
- brands do allow for profitable growth, but traditional methods for segmentation
and building brands are not adequate in practice compared to purpose branding
of products toward doing jobs
