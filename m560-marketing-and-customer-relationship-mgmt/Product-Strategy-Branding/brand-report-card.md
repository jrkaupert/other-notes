# Notes from *The Brand Report Card* #
By Kevin Lane Keller

## Summary ##
### Idea in Brief ###
- many companies struggle to manage brand performance despite the seemingly
easy prospect of increasing brand equity to increase profits

- **A brand report card** allows companies to see how its brand measures up
against some of the strongest brands in the world
- allows actions to be identified that will produce results toward maximizing
brand equity, resulting in increased loyalty and profits

### Idea in Practice ###
How to grade your brand:
Assess how your brand:
1. Delivers benefits that customers want, which engages them, such as Starbucks
providing an overall Italian coffee bar experience that appeals to senses
beyond merely taste
2. Stays relevant, so that brand elements change as consumer needs and tastes
do, such as Gillette changing messaging to target men at work AND play to
reflect current trends
3. is priced, based on consumer perceptions of brand value, such that staples
and premium products are priced accordingly, as Proctor & Gamble prices things
as household staples with "everyday low pricing"
4. is positioned, such that it identifies similarities and differences to
competing brands, as Visa "Gold" and "Platinum" compare to AMEX but Visa also
makes sure consumers know about its availability in places where AMEX isn't
accepted
5. is consistent, such that messaging (Marketing) doesn't conflict with itself
over time, as occurred with Michelob's market share over 18 years when
inconsistencies in marketing shrunk overall market share
6. fits into brand portfolio, such that brands work together, as Gap, Old Navy,
and Banana Republic all target different groups (broad mass-market, basic style
  and quality, and high-end, respectively)
7. has an integrated marketing strategy, such that all marketing actions and
distribution channels have a unified message of the brand, which unifies the
overall identity, as with Coca-Cola (originality and classic refreshment)
8. has meanings that managers understand, such that they can assess how
customers vary in their perceptions of the brand, as Gillette keeps Braun as
a separate brand to protect the manual razor market from electric razor
cannibalization
9. receives sustained support, such that companies continually invest in
furthering and keeping their brand awareness, even after the customer already
things positively of it
10. is constantly monitored, using a brand-equity-management system or similar,
as Disney used to identify that consumers would not react well to a Disney
branded mutual fund

## Introduction ##
- managing brand equity is key in all industries for companies big and small
- few managers can accurately and objectively assess their brand's strengths
and weaknesses well
- a brand report card provides a systematic way to assess brand performance
across 10 key areas that the world's strongest brands excel in
  - allows areas needing improvement to be identified
  - recognizes strong areas
  - promotes learning more about the brand
- can make brand report cards for competitors too to identify their strengths
and weaknesses
- NOTE: weak spots should not necessarily be focused on if they undermine
another stronger area!
- most simply, brands are made up of any marketing elements that can be
trademarked (logos, symbols, slogans, packaging, signs, etc...)
- brands also provide information about the product, how it is used, why it
should be used, when/where, by whom, and can be used to associate other things
to the product to enhance its overall image
- "pull" functions are designed to create consumer demand (traditional ads)
- "push" functions are designed to push the product through distribution
channels

## Top Ten Traits ##
- see idea in practice section for most of the details
- some additional details from the main article:
  - relevance also includes how consumers view company participation in society
  at large now (not just traditional advertising, logos, slogans)
- price affects how customers think of a product and most managers fail to
adequately price (they go too high or too low)

> "Maintaining a strong brand means striking the right balance between
continuity and change."

> "Boundaries are important. Overlapping two brands in the same portfolio can
be dangerous."

## Rating Your Brand ##
Questions to ask when rating your brand (ask thru customer's eyes, not yours!):
1. Delivering benefits that are actually desired:
  - Have you uncovered unmet desires/needs?
  - Do you continually focus on maximizing customer experience?
  - Do you have a way for customers to provide feedback to people who can
  actually create change?
2. Staying relevant:
  - Are investments being made in the product to provide better value to the
  customer?
  - Are you keeping up with customer tastes and market trends, and making
  marketing decisions accordingly?
3. Pricing strategy alignment with perception of value:
  - Have price, cost, and quality been aligned to meet/exceed customer
  expectations?
  - Do you have systems to monitor perceptions of brand value?
  - Have you estimated the customer perception of how much value the brand
  adds to the product?
4. Proper brand positioning:
  - Have you established parity with competitors as necessary?
  - Have you established desired and real points of difference?
5. Brand consistency:
  - Are marketing communications consistent over time, not conflicting with
  one another, and are you adjusting to keep marketing programs current?
6. Portfolio & Hierarchy:
  - Does the corporate brand serve as a unified umbrella for all brands in the
  portfolio?
  - Does each brand in the portfolio have a niche purpose?
  - How much overlap is there between brands?
  - How much do brands maximize market coverage?
  - Is the brand hierarchy well-designed and understood?
7. Coordination of efforts to build equity:
  - Are name, logo, packaging, slogan, etc... designed to maximize awareness?
  - Are push and pull marketing activities in place to target customers as
  well as distributors?
  - Are all marketing activities involving the brand understood?
  - Are the people involved aware of other peoples' activities?
  - Are communications consistent despite unique comms channel benefits?
8. Manager understanding of brand meaning to customers:
  - What do customers like and not like, and do you know this?
  - What are all of the associations with your brand, whether deliberately
  made by your company or not?
  - Do you have detailed personas for your target customers, representative of
  actual people based on research?
  - Do you have customer-driven boundaries for brand extensions, and ways to
  execute on marketing programs?
9. Proper support, sustained over time:
  - Are potential success/failure conditions understood before marketing
  initiatives are modified?
  - Is enough R&D being provided to the brand?
  - Are you keeping marketing support up despite short-term poor market
  conditions?
10. Brand equity monitoring:
  - Does a brand charter exist, defining the meaning and equity of the brand
  and its use?
  - Are brand audits conducted to assess strategic focus?
  - Is market performance being tracked on a regular basis?
  - Are brand equity reports provided to marketing teams to summarize any
  relevant results from research about the brand equity?
  - Is someone directly responsible for the tracking and maintaining of brand
  equity?

## The Value of Balance ##
- strong brands will try to maximize all 10 characteristics listed for the
brand report card, but often improving one leads to losses in another, so
care needs to be taken

## Brand Equity as a Bridge ##
- customers contain the ultimate brand power in their minds, as their
perceptions change over time about the brand based on using it and seeing
others use it
- brand equity = bridge from past to future, such that dollars spent on
marketing efforts can be an investment in the future in what consumers believe
about the brand
  - need to make sure they are good investments, by carefully considering
  actions taken with respect to the brand
- everything done by the company can improve or hurt brand equity
