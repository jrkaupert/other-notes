# Notes from *Advertising's New Medium: Human Experience* #
By Jeffrey F. Rayport

## Idea in Brief ##
- As media consumes the world, it is becoming less and less effective to try to influence through 
interruptions and repetition.
- effective engagement requires identifying and utilizing advertising when consumers will be most receptive
to it

Four domains of human experience for embedding ads:
1. Public Sphere - Moving from one place/activity to another, online and offline
2. Social Sphere - Where interactions and relationships with others occur
3. Tribal Sphere - Where we affliate ourselves with groups in order to define and express identity
4. Psychological Sphere - Where we connect language and specific thoughts and feelings together

- Each sphere varies in its usefulness in pushing behaviors desired by marketers including awareness,
purchase, and loyalty
- messages must offer value, and must be trusted and welcomed by customers in each of these domains

## Introduction ##
- advertising is everywhere these days, infiltrating more and more channels, filled with marketing messages
- ad strategies focused on trying to persuade via interruption, repetition, and sheer omnipresent volume
are becoming more and more ineffective as the world saturates with media
  - people escape via DVRs (to skip commercials), pop-up blockers in browsers, and even pay content 
  providers to avoid advertisements (Pandora)
- marketers must reshape their overall ad strategies and expand their definition of what advertising is
- human experience is a huge medium for advertising, as long as marketers are careful in creating and 
placing their messages, and as long as consumers are open to the messaging, allowing brands into their
lives

## Be a Presence ##
- traditional messaging and creative endeavors are becoming outdated
- getting attention is less about what advertising says, and more about what it will do for them
- ad campaigns shouldn't focus on a single emphasis with a start, middle, and end, but rather a sustained,
rewarding element in the lives of target consumers
- two-way engagement with consumers is reshaping how marketing works
- dynamic execution (changing ads on the fly to suit the tastes of a specific consumer online) allows
marketers to pick messages that will more likely resonate with the target consumer based on browsing
history, social media use, purchase behavior, and demographics
- regardless of how great your message is, merely making the biggest splash across media platforms is
not sustainable or effective (will not be welcomed by consumers)
- the medium of human experience has four key domains, the public sphere, the social sphere, the tribal
sphere, and the psychological sphere
  - marketers have used these spheres in the past too, but not as strategically as is demanded by the
  latest shifts
  - focusing on how consumers live their lives and where they will be most receptive to messaging in 
  these domains produces better results than focusing on communication strategy and marketing mix as
  is traditional

## The Public Sphere ##
- engages consumers as they move between places or activities
  - consumers have free attention for new inputs in these moments (driving, elevators, gas pumps)
  - online, real-time bidding and dynamic execution allow thousands of different variations of an ad
  to be presented in real-time, targeting a specific consumer, and more and more even their location within
  milliseconds
  - they may become less of an intrusion over time based on their targeted relevance
  - mobile apps that leverage these capabilities can be very effective in reaching consumers between
  activities or on the move, as that's when people are most likely to swap to their devices
- typically address a specific practical function, but may also address needs in other spheres

Ads in the public sphere are effective when:
1. They are relevant to their context - they need to resonate at the moment the consumer is experiencing 
them, in the context of whatever their location or activity is
2. They help people reach personal objectives - the advertising can actually transport people while 
providing the message (buses, taxis, zipcars, etc...)
3. They are branded interventions - targeted, useful intrusions, only when desired or needed
4. They are engaging, refreshing, or provide compelling experiences - random pop-up experiences that are
unexpected

## The Social Sphere ##
- help people make new connections or improve existing ones
- can make social interactions conduits of advertising messaging
- any advertising that encourages consumers to pass the message along fits in here
- emphasizes broad, diverse networks

Ads in the social sphere are effective when:
1. They are relevant in the social context
2. They address a social need or solve a social problem
3. They make social interactions easier

## The Tribal Sphere ##
- emphasizes narrower social engagement than the social sphere
- marketers can help people identify with groups
- must fit with character and values of the consumers involved

Ads in the tribal sphere are effective when:
1. They address needs for self-expression or identity
2. They provide social signal or status markers
3. They provide a form of affiliation
4. They empower the individual

## The Psychological Sphere ##
- in some sense, all advertising operates in this domain, but ads that are focused on adding words,
phrases, or emotions into the psyche in order to encourage action or produce feelings are key here
- these ads work in one of four ways usually:
  1. use language to create an anchor point for a brand (Apple: "Think Different", Nike: "Just Do It")
    - may move brands into everyday language (the verbs "Xerox", "Google", "FedEx", "to friend", 
    "to follow", etc...)
  2. work to create habits
  3. guide thinking, while advertising the brand
  4. connect a brand with a mood or emotion

Ads in the psychological sphere are effective when:
1. They provide new ways to express ideas
2. They link a brand with an action or attribute
3. They link a word to a pattern of thought
4. They associate a brand with an emotion

## Placing Ads in the Spheres ##
- though similar to traditional advertising, advertising in the four domains mentioned is customer-focused
rather than media-focused
  - don't worry about the media/channel used first, decide instead how the advertising can integrate into
  customer lives in order to deliver value and build trust
  - advertising campaigns are no longer finite, instead being sustained over time

5 step framework for applying these concepts:
1. Define objectives from the consumer's standpoint - clear objectives are important (are we trying to
build awareness, encourage consideration, persuade to purchase, reinforce loyalty?)
2. Make sure the campaign delivers value to customers - pick one or more spheres for initial efforts and
identify where consumers' and advertisers' interests intersect
  - often ads in public sphere drive awareness, trial, and purchase, where tribal sphere ads tend to 
  drive purchase, brand preference, and loyalty (social sphere drives trial, and to some degree awareness,
  purchase, brand pref and loyalty; psychological sphere drives awareness, brand pref, and loyalty, with
  some degree of purchase)
3. Test and iterate on ads to improve customer experience - dynamically test the effectiveness of ads
4. Consider an expansion strategy - it may be necessary to change which spheres are being targeted at 
different points of a campaign
5. Be on the lookout for ways to refresh the message - attitudes and behaviors are changing rapidly and 
must be gauged and responded to in real-time, especially for public sphere advertising

- Must get permission from consumers, and engage them with respect
  - need to avoid being invasive, exploitative
  - must be useful to the consumer
