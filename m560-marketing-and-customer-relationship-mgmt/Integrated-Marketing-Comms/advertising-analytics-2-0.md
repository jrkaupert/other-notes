# Notes from *Advertising Analytics 2.0* #
By Wes Nichols

## Idea in Brief ##
- analytics 2.0 = set of data capabilities that can crunch massive data sets and hundreds of variables 
in real-time
- this data can provide insights into how advertising touch points dynamically interact
  - can lead to 10-30% improvements in marketing performance
- moving to advertising analytics has 3 primary activities:
  1. Attribution = quantifying contribution of advertising elements
  2. Optimization = predictive analytics to run business planning scenarios
  3. Allocation = changing resources in real-time across marketing activities
- need infrastructure, and integration of it into the organizational culture, strategy development, and
operations
- companies that don't do this will lose out to those that do

## Introduction ##
- many companies still evaluate their advertising channels one at a time, in isolation, for how they
drive sales
  - more and more, these channels interact
  - ie: a TV ad can lead to a Google search, that leads to a click-through on a display ad, that results in
  a sale
- analysis of channels together may provide information about what's actually more effective
- traditionally, media-mix modeling has been used to aid in allocating marketing resources
  - used with consumer surveys, focus groups, and last-click attribution
  - marketers have been lulled into complacency
  - ads don't actually work in isolation, however
- different teams, agencies, and media buyers operate in their own silos, with their own metrics, while
they compete for the same budget pool
- **swim-lane measurement** = markets attributing outcomes to marketing activities when in reality they
may have come from elsewhere.  Leads to doubt from finance groups about the value of marketing
(Adding up ROI from each functional group may make the company look bigger than it actually is)

## Data Deluge ##
- tech and consumer behavior have changed dramatically over the last decade, and created massive amounts
of detailed data about consumer online behaviors
  - marketers have access to massive amounts of information about how consumers see the world and act
- in order to make use of this information, we need good ways to filter and process the data
- Analytics 1.0 techniques looked backward at data, a few times a year, to forecast based on a small
number of variables
- In contrast, Analytics 2.0 looks at data in real-time, based on hundreds of variables at a time
  - allows companies to assess performance, evaluate scenarios, and change strategy in real-time
  - companies may be able to use same level of existing budget and achieve 10-30% increases in performance
  from their marketing efforts

## The Move to 2.0 ##
- big data, cloud computing, and new analytical methods provide the foundation for the Analytics 2.0 
revolution

3 primary activities for marketing to use Analytics 2.0:
1. Attribution = quantifying contribution of advertising elements
  - gather data 
    - usually companies already have tons of it even if they think they don't
    - sales, finance, customer service, distribution, other functions outside of marketing have it
  - identify what to focus on
    - market conditions
      - consumer confidence
      - unemployment rates
      - fuel prices
      - season
      - other economic factors
    - competitive actions
      - new-product releases
      - pricing
      - promotions
      - competitor advertising
    - marketing actions
      - print ads
      - TV ads
      - direct mail
      - native content
      - radio
      - social media
      - paid search
      - online display
      - mobile apps
      - cinema
      - public relations
      - earned media
      - pricing
      - promotions
      - customer service
      - sales activities
    - consumer response
      - search
      - online chatter
      - store visits
      - purchasing
    - business outcomes
      - unit sales
      - revenues
      - margins
      - market share
      - share of voice
      - customer lifetime value
  - **assist rates** = indirect effects of interactions between advertising media
  - can help determine social media actual effects on short and long-term revenue and brand equity
2. Optimization = running scenarios with predictive analytics for planning purposes
  - run what-ifs of your own or competitor actions
  - can identify elasticity for each measure (ratio of percentage change in one variable to the percentage
  change in another)
  - can use "war games" to see how elasticities of drivers affect results to try to reach marketing goals
  developed by team members (revenue targets, market share goals, margin goals)
  - can identify how to shift dollars from national advertising to local advertising for gains without 
  changing overall budget spent
3. Allocation = redistributing resources across marketing efforts in real-time
  - setting a marketing plan and letting it play out over a year is becoming less and less common
- these activities occur in real-time in practice, not in sequence

## Five Steps to Implementation ##
- analytics is becoming a part of daily strategy and operations
- marketing is becoming a war of knowledge, insight, and asymmetric advantage

1. Embrance Analytics 2.0 in a firm-wide initiative with a C-level sponsor
2. Identify an analytics-focused director/manager to lead the effort
3. Develop prioritzed list of questions you want answers for, and inventory what data is available already
  - consolidate data sets, integrate systems
4. Start small with proof-of-concepts in small segments, using models with limited scope for early wins
5. Test aggressively, and provide the results as inputs to the model to refine it
  - consider external help once complexity gets to be too much for the organization
