# Notes from *Branding in the Digital Age* #
By David C. Edelman

## Idea in Brief ##
- Consumers are connecting to brands differently than in the past
  - media channels that firms don't have control over
  - new marketing strategies are required
- Previously, consumers would narrow down a set of brand choices to make a
final determination of product, finishing engagement at that point
  - now, digital channels offer continually changing offerings, and the consumer
  is engaged with a brand even after the point of purchase through social media
- new marketing should focus on the new "customer decision journey"
  - refocus strategy, advertising, and organizational roles

## Introduction ##
- the internet has fundamentally changed how consumers interact with brands, and
has changed the overall economics of marketing, obsoleting traditional marketing
practices in the process
- the touch points where consumers are most open to being swayed has changed,
and the ways to interact with them at those points have changed

## Block that Metaphor ##
- traditional marketing has used the funnel as a metaphor for considering touch
points
  - consumers start with lots of brands, narrow down to a final decision
  - "paid-media" push marketing at specific points in the funnel have
  traditionally been used to build brand awareness and drive purchases
  - this metaphor is failing to handle new engagement
- The "Customer Decision Journey" is a new way of looking at consumer engagement
with brands
  - new consumer approach is more iterative, less reductive
    1. consider
    2. evaluate
    3. buy
    4. enjoy, advocate, & bond

Consider:
- consumers start with a "consideration set", products/brands they have been
exposed to via any number of means (ads, word of mouth, media)
  - traditionally consumers have considered large numbers of models at this
  point, but now they are often reducing the number up front given the amount
  of media and choices available

Evaluate:
Consumers will add and subtract products from the consideration set as they
research (peers, reviewers, retails, brand, and competitors)
  - may reach out to markets in the process, which may shape their choices

Buy:
More and more, consumers delay a purchase decision until they're in a store,
and at that point may not even buy!
  - point of sale is even more powerful than before, as placement, packaging,
  availability, pricing, and sales communication are extremely effective at
  this touch point

Enjoy, advocate, & bond:
After buying, consumers begin to interact even more with the product, often
doing research online afer buying the product (a piece that doesn't exist
in the traditional funnel at all)
  - may advocate by word of mouth to friends
  - may speak out if disappointed
  - if the bond is strong enough, may enter an enjoy-advocate-buy loop that
  short circuits the consider and evaluate steps altogether

## The Journey in Practice ##
Two key implications for marketers:
1. focus should be aimed at stages in the decision journey rather than
allocation of funds across channels
  - consumers are more readily influenced during evaluate and
  enjoy-advocate-bond stages than during consider and buy stages where up to
  90% of expenditures on advertising and promotions typically occur
  - someone else's advocacy is often the most compelling reason for someone to
  buy
    - media spending is typically the focus instead of driving advocacy
    - need strong reviews, or at the very least, actual online discussion, in
    order to survive the journey
2. Marketing budgets are constructed around outdated strategies
  - previously, comms were one way, and all interactions with consumers
  consisted of variable media costs that usually outweighed the fixed costs
  of using creatives (working media spend / paid media)
  - Now, owned media (channels such as websites), and earned media
  (customer-driven communities of enthusiasts) must also be considered, as well
  as "nonworking" spend to cover people and tech needed to develop, manage, and
  deliver content across many channels, as well as participate actively in
  engaging those channels

## Launching a Pilot ##
3 parts to changing to a Customer Decision Journey strategy:
1. Understand the journey
  - how do consumers evaluate options?
  - what sites do they use?
  - how do they engage with online communities?
  - interview people, ask about stages of the journey both online and offline
  - most valuable resources in the journey?
  - most disappointing resources in the journey?
  - how were brands added or eliminated?
  - how was ultimate decision made
2. Identify touch points, prioritize them, and understand how to leverage them
3. Allocate resources appropriately

## Taking Action ##
- spending should likely be shifted away from paid media, and links on
manufacturer sites need to link to retail sites, with retailer relationships
maintained to keep links working both ways
- may require new content developers and content management systems

## A Customer Experience Plan ##
- the decision journey often shows the need for a plan that helps make a
customer's experience coherent
  - all touch points need to be consistent, accurate, and integrated

## New Roles for Marketing ##
- new roles are required in the marketing organization that chooses to use
a customer decision journey driven strategy
  - Orchestrator: someone such as the chief marketing officer needs to be
  responsible for coordinating various owned-media channels such as website,
  product packaging, customer service, and sales
  - Publisher & "Content Supply Chain" manager: content is increasing, and
  marketing organizations are publishing more and more, including videos,
  coupons and promotions, applications and decision support systems
    - all of this needs to be coordinated in order to make sure it's effective
    and provides a consistent message
    - uncoordinated publishing can delay the decision journey
  - marketplace intelligence leader: marketing data needs to be under the
  control of the marketing organization, not IT, so that customer data can be
  analyzed and acted on strategically rather than be used from IT's traditional
  cost-efficiency perspective
    - customer insights need to be distributed across the organization to other
    groups

## Starting the Journey ##
- many pilots start with a narrow segment so a single customer decision journey
can be understood before entire company strategy is shifted
- best results occur when bottom-up and top-down approaches are used in parallel
so that cross-functional, infrastructural, and organizational challenges can
be addressed adequately
- processes, success, and failures must be documented for pilots so the program
may be adapted and scaled to the entire organization
  - specific tactics may vary across markets even though the general customer
  decision journey strategy details remain the same
