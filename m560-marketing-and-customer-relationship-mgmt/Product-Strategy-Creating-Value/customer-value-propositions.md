# Notes from *Customer Value Propositions in Business Markets* #
Article by James C. Anderson, James A. Narus, & Wouter van Rossum

## Summary ##
### Idea In Brief ###
- everyone is under pressure to control costs, so they seem to focus on only
price, but lowering price to stimulate sales shrinks profits
- How to get business customers to pay premium prices?
  - craft a compelling customer value proposition
  - research your business customers & identify their particular needs
  - explain how your offering is better than your rivals' on the things that
  matter most to your customers
  - document the actual cost savings and profit delivered by your products to
  existing customers, and that will be delivered to new customers
- such an approach helps your customers cut costs while generating profitable
growth for your own company

### In Practice ###
- In order to craft winning customer value propositions:
1. Understand Customer Businesses - spend time and effort to really understand
their unique requirements and preferences
2. Make substantiated value claims - don't just say you can save them money,
back it up persuasively that differentiates you from competitors and shows
the actual monetary worth to the customer
3. Document Value Delivered - write up actual accounts of cost savings or
value added for existing customers that use your products.  Do on-site pilots
for prospective customer sites to gather data on how your product will perform
4. Make customer value proposition a central business skill - improve and
incentivize managers that can create good customer value propositions

## Introduction ##
- definitions of customer value proposition vary widely
- the savings and benefits claimed often are not backed up with evidence
- customer value propositions should be more than just advertising or
marketing spin, they should provide a real contribution of value leading to
better business performance

## Three Kinds of Value Propositions ##
1. All benefits
  - most managers just make a list of benefits that the product might deliver
  to customers
  - the more the better, in the eyes of the managers
  - requires very little knowledge of customers or competitors
  - drawback: **benefit assertion** = managers claim advantages for features
  that actually do not benefit customers
  - drawback: most benefits listed may actually just be points of parity with
  the next best alternative product, reducing the emphasis of the real benefits
  on the list.  Distinctness is overshadowed by sameness against other companies
2. Favorable points of difference
  - recognizes that a customer has an alternative
  - answers question of "Why should we purchase your product instead of your
  competitor's"
  - requires knowledge of competitor's offering or an alternate solution to
  a customer's problem
  - despite providing a point of difference against alternatives, no value is
  conveyed to customer about the magnitude of the difference
  - multiple points of difference make it difficult to understand which points
  are the most valuable to the customer
  - drawback: **value presumption** = assuming the favorable points of
  difference you provide are valuable to the customer
3. Resonating Focus
  - the best option for crafting a consumer value proposition
  - this method takes into account that managers making purchase decisions have
  more responsibility and have little time for making decisions
    - these managers want suppliers that understand their critical issues
    - want suppliers that deliver a simple but effective customer value
    proposition
  - such propositions have superior offerings in just a few important areas
  that are of highest importance to customers, with the benefits clearly
  demonstrated and documented in the terms of their value to the customer,
  and communicated effectively
  - more is NOT better, as is the case in the other two methods
  - focuses on only one or two differences that provide the greatest benefits
  - using this approach, your offering doesn't even need to be the best at
  everything in terms of favorable points of difference
  - resonating focus propositions may contain a point of parity for two reasons:
    1. customer won't consider a supplier's offering without it
    2. supplier needs to counter something its competitors view as a difference
    in favor of the competitor (customer thinks the competition has a better
      offering but the supplier wants to assert them as equals, using actual
      empirical evidence)
  - effective, but more difficult to create than other kinds of propositions
    - require insights about the customer gained through research
    - very few suppliers actually go through this process
