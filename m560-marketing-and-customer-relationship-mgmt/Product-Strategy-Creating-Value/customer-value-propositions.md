# Notes from *Customer Value Propositions in Business Markets* #
Article by James C. Anderson, James A. Narus, & Wouter van Rossum

## Summary ##
### Idea In Brief ###
- everyone is under pressure to control costs, so they seem to focus on only
price, but lowering price to stimulate sales shrinks profits
- How to get business customers to pay premium prices?
  - craft a compelling customer value proposition
  - research your business customers & identify their particular needs
  - explain how your offering is better than your rivals' on the things that
  matter most to your customers
  - document the actual cost savings and profit delivered by your products to
  existing customers, and that will be delivered to new customers
- such an approach helps your customers cut costs while generating profitable
growth for your own company

### In Practice ###
- In order to craft winning customer value propositions:
1. Understand Customer Businesses - spend time and effort to really understand
their unique requirements and preferences
2. Make substantiated value claims - don't just say you can save them money,
back it up persuasively that differentiates you from competitors and shows
the actual monetary worth to the customer
3. Document Value Delivered - write up actual accounts of cost savings or
value added for existing customers that use your products.  Do on-site pilots
for prospective customer sites to gather data on how your product will perform
4. Make customer value proposition a central business skill - improve and
incentivize managers that can create good customer value propositions

## Introduction ##
- definitions of customer value proposition vary widely
- the savings and benefits claimed often are not backed up with evidence
- customer value propositions should be more than just advertising or
marketing spin, they should provide a real contribution of value leading to
better business performance

## Three Kinds of Value Propositions ##
1. All benefits
  - most managers just make a list of benefits that the product might deliver
  to customers
  - the more the better, in the eyes of the managers
  - requires very little knowledge of customers or competitors
  - drawback: **benefit assertion** = managers claim advantages for features
  that actually do not benefit customers
  - drawback: most benefits listed may actually just be points of parity with
  the next best alternative product, reducing the emphasis of the real benefits
  on the list.  Distinctness is overshadowed by sameness against other companies
2. Favorable points of difference
  - recognizes that a customer has an alternative
  - answers question of "Why should we purchase your product instead of your
  competitor's"
  - requires knowledge of competitor's offering or an alternate solution to
  a customer's problem
  - despite providing a point of difference against alternatives, no value is
  conveyed to customer about the magnitude of the difference
  - multiple points of difference make it difficult to understand which points
  are the most valuable to the customer
  - drawback: **value presumption** = assuming the favorable points of
  difference you provide are valuable to the customer
3. Resonating Focus
  - the best option for crafting a consumer value proposition
  - this method takes into account that managers making purchase decisions have
  more responsibility and have little time for making decisions
    - these managers want suppliers that understand their critical issues
    - want suppliers that deliver a simple but effective customer value
    proposition
  - such propositions have superior offerings in just a few important areas
  that are of highest importance to customers, with the benefits clearly
  demonstrated and documented in the terms of their value to the customer,
  and communicated effectively
  - more is NOT better, as is the case in the other two methods
  - focuses on only one or two differences that provide the greatest benefits
  - using this approach, your offering doesn't even need to be the best at
  everything in terms of favorable points of difference
  - resonating focus propositions may contain a point of parity for two reasons:
    1. customer won't consider a supplier's offering without it
    2. supplier needs to counter something its competitors view as a difference
    in favor of the competitor (customer thinks the competition has a better
      offering but the supplier wants to assert them as equals, using actual
      empirical evidence)
  - effective, but more difficult to create than other kinds of propositions
    - require insights about the customer gained through research
    - very few suppliers actually go through this process

## Which Alternative Conveys Value to Customers? ##
| Value Proposition | All Benefits| Favorable Points of Difference | Resonating Focus |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Consists Of:   | As many benefits as can be listed for an offering | Favorable points of difference an offering has compared to next best alternative | 1-2 Key differences, possibly a point of parity, where greatest value is delivered to customer |
| Answers the question: | "Why should our company buy your offering?" | "Why should we pick yours over your competitor's?" | "What is most important for us to consider about your offering?" |
| Requires: | Knowledge of own offering | Knowledge of own offering and next best alternative | Knowledge of how own offering delivers greater value to customers than next best alternative |
| Pitfalls: | Benefit Assertion | Value Presumption | Requires detailed customer value research |

## Substantiate Customer Value Propositions ##
- "We can save you money" is generic and overused, and most suppliers cannot
actually back this up
- must be able to actually prove the value that can be provided
- **Value Word Equations** = expression using both words and mathematical
operators to show differences in one offering vs NBA, and how those differences
can be measured in dollars
  - information required may come from customer business operations, but could
  also come from outside sources
  - may use industry jargon to persuasively communicate details

## The Building Blocks of a Successful Customer Value Proposition ##
- supplier offerings may have many technical, economic, service, or social
benefits for customers
  - most likely, so do competitors' offerings
- key question: "How do your offering's benefits that provide value compare to
those of the next best alternative?"
- three types of value:
  1. points of parity = similar/same performance as NBA
  2. points of difference = areas where offering is better/worse than NBA
  3. points of contention = areas where supplier and customer are in
  disagreement about value difference between offering and NBA

## Demonstrate Customer Value in Advance ##
- Customers need to see the expected savings or added value from your offering
compared to the NBA
- **Value Case Histories** = documentation of the cost savings or value added
by an offering for customers that have already used the offering
- **Value Calculators** = tools to assess estimated value a customer would
receive from the offering, often spreadsheet software or similar, used in
consultative selling

## Document Customer Value ##
- merely demonstrating value is necessary but not sufficient for top companies
- cost savings and increase profits must be documented to the companies that
use them
- must work with customer to agree on how savings or profits will be tracked
so that actual results from using the offering can be documented
- suppliers gain knowledge over time as they use the documenting process to
better understand how they provide value to customers, and how such value
varies across different types of customers
  - improves future predictions of cost savings and added value
  - can even offer guarantees to prospective customers as a risk-reduction
  based on this knowledge

## Superior Business Performance ##
- customer value propositions, executed properly, can make a big impact on
business strategy and overall performance
- can be used on scorecards as ways to assess whether or not profitable growth
can be attained from such offerings
- can be integrated into overall business strategy as a key element for
providing superior value to customers
