# Notes from How Do You Know When the Price is Right? #
by Robert J. Dolan

## Introduction ##
- managers struggle over pricing
  - pressured to perform
  - lack of certainty on how to do well and know they are doing well
  - believe they don't have contorl over price (dictated by the market)
  - foregone profits don't show up on scorecards
- slight improvements can provide major results
  - 1% improvement in price with 8% profit margin leads to 12.5% increase in margin dollars if 
  unit sales volumes remains the same
- to improve pricing, start with the process instead of the outcome
  - don't ask "What should the price be?"
  - ask instead "Have we addressed all of the things that will determine the correct price?"
  
## Strategy and Coordination ##
- successful pricing hinges on two qualities: company marketing strategy must be complemented by pricing
and the pricing process must be coordinated and holistic

### Marketing Strategy ###
- pricing sends a message to the market, a sense of company philosophy
- "Price has become a mirror for the other attributes we try to communicate"
- pricing policy must follow straight from the overall marketing strategy

### Coordination ###
- lots of people are involved in the pricing process - this process needs to be coordinated across 
functions
  - everyone making changes to prices (often to optimize their own department's needs/interests) often
  results in a less-than-optimal overall result for the company
  - must have a coordinated process in place for deciding pricing
  - ask:
    - What is the pricing objective?
    - Does everyone involved in pricing understand the objective?
    - Does everyone involved have sufficient incentive to pursue this objective?

## Eight Steps to Better Pricing ##
1. Assess the value customers believe the product or service offers
- for most companies, product cost drives pricing decisions
  - cost + markup = final price
  - inside-out approach
- instead, companies should take an outside-in approach and review how customers will value the 
product
2. Identify variation in how customers value the product
- customizing prices can lead to much greater results than a single price policy
  - ideal customers will often value a product much more highly than an average customer would
  - think business class vs. coach
- in some industries, price customization is basically required
  - existing software users are charged less than users without the software, because the upgrade is
  worth less than if they didn't have the software in the first place
- Questions to ask:
  - How does intensity of use vary across customers?
    - heavier use generally commands higher price
    - heavy users may also want more features or complementary products
  - do customers use the product differently?
    - may have a different perceived value based on how they use the product
  - does product performance matter more to some customers more than others, even if the application
  is the same?
3. Assess price sensitivity
- price elasticity = % change in qty sold given 1% change in price
- on average, if a company raises prices by 1%, quantity of sales drops by 2%, but that may not be helpful
for pricing decisions, since elasticity can vary wildly across industries or brands
- price sensitivity factors:
  - Is the decision maker paying to buy the product for himself?
  - Does the cost of the item total a large portion of the total expenditure?
  - Is the buyer the end user, and if not, will the buyer face competition on price in the end-user
  market?
  - Does higher price signal higher quality in this market?
  - Is it costly for the buyer to shop around?
  - Is the time of purchase/delivery significant to the buyer?
  - Is the buyer able to compare price and performance of alternatives?
  - Is the buyer able to readily switch suppliers without large costs?
  - How does this offering differ from competitors'?
  - How do company reputation or other intangibles affect the buyer's decision?
4. Identify the best pricing structure
- Need to consider if product/service will be sold individually or bundled in a combined offer
- different customers may react differently to different pricing schedules,
revenue can be maximized by understanding how customers value the product
- bundle pricing should be carefully considered as well
  - may want to give up some initial profit potential to increase volume and 
  overall demand potential
  - bundling may produce better profits if selling one product individually
  would otherwise be undesirable
5. Consider possible competitor reactions
- competitors can easily respond to poor pricing moves and lead to price wars
if not careful
- consider how competitors will change their behaviors based on your pricing:
  - What will their thoughts be when they see the price?
  - What would you do if you were the competition, and can you combat that?
  - What's the overall impact to industry profitability if such a pricing
  action is taken?
6. Monitor prices at the point of sale
- pricing can be very complicated when considering discounts for early payment,
rebates, negotiated discounts and other factors such as returns, damage claims, and other
special consideration given to specific customers
  - despite the real price being based on all of these factors, most companies only focus on the list price
  - this can lead to a lot of missed profit
  - a full analysis of the overall pricing must be performed
7. Evaluate customer emotional responses
- what are the long-term effects of the customer's emotional reaction to price?
- what are the short-term economic effects?
- keeping price low can have long-term benefits even though some profit is left on the table
- increasing awareness can mitigate perception issues with pricing
- market research can identify if there are perception issues at hand
8. Analyze if the returns produced are worth the required cost to serve
- while customer value is critical in pricing, managers must also look at cost
- not all high cost customers will generate high revenue, nor will all low cost customers generate low revenue;
there may be no relationship between costs and revenue generated at all, and often isn't
- "strategic accounts" are infamous for being large, demanding of customizations and other expensive support, 
and services, and also paying later than most and requiring discounts most don't
  - often get a lot more than they pay for
  - companies lose a lot of money on them (high cost, low revenue)
- high cost accounts can be great if they are also high revenue
