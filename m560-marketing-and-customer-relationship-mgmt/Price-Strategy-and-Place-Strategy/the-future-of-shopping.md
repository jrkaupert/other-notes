# Notes on *The Future of Shopping* #
By Darrell Ribgy

## Idea in Brief ##
- Traditional retailers have been slow to adopt digital tech
  - To survive they need to focus on a "omnichannel" retail strategy - integrated sales experience
  that merges the plusses of physical stores with the benefits of high-information online shopping
  - challenges - many retailers aren't tech-savvy and will need to adapt, recruit new types of talent,
  and focus on new metrics
  - stores need to be transformed from a liability into an asset in order to gain an advantage over
  internet retailers

## Introduction ##
- retailers undergo disruption on a regular basis, every 50 years or so, and are due for another
- the landscape will be significantly redefined by advances in technology
- digital sales are growing rapidly (haha 2011 article)
- digital retailing => "omnichannel retailing" = consumers can interact with various channels including
physical stores, websites, kiosks, direct mail, catalogs, call centers, social media, mobile devices, 
gaming consoles, tv, IoT appliances, home services, and more
- traditional retailers need to embrace a new perspective that integrates these channels rather than 
avoiding them

## An Industry Stuck in Analog ##
- easy search through massive selection will only continue to propel digital growth
  - convenient (don't spend on gas, don't spend time driving, don't hassle with parking, often free shipping and
  returns, tons of product reviews)
- digital retailers focusing spending on driving innovation via recruiting, wages, technical talent
- focused on using cloud computing (lowering entry, operating costs)
- utilizing social networking and online ads to increase marketing efficiency
- amidst the digital growth, traditional retailers are suffering
  - these companies are not innovating digitally
  - not integrating technology into physical stores
  - managers are often technically illiterate and afraid to change the culture

## Four Factors Holding Traditional Retailers Back ##
1. Retailers were burned by e-commerce hype in dot-com bubble
- new, separate, online organizations were created to maximize valuation
- these targeted different segments and created friction with the main organization
  - when dot-com bubble occurred, traditional stores celebrated the failures of these new divisions
  - collaboration remains rare between store and digital operations
2. Existing store economics, measurement systems, and incentives are threatened
- same-store sales, in-store sales per labor hour, and other similar metrics that have been used for
decades are still driving decisions in these stores
- as online sales increases, such metrics will cause the economics to fall apart
3. Retailers tend to focus on the wrong metric: Profit Margins
- traditional retailers look at profit margin as everything; anything that reduces margins is bad
- stock prices are driven more from return on invested capital and growth, not margins, so this is 
the wrong approach
4. Retailers haven't had good experiences with breakthrough innovation
- retailers have only been comfortable with incremental improvement, with many radical changes in 
the past producing poor results
  - "If it's such a good idea, why is no one else doing it?" syndrome
- the tendency is to believe that their customers will always be there
  - over time, customers are becoming less tolerant of store conditions
    - difficulty in finding sales associates
    - sales associates that don't know the merchandise
    - stockouts
    - long checkout lines
    - difficulty in returning things

## Redesign Shopping from Scratch ##
- retailers must face reality in order to execute a new strategy
  - tech will only get faster, cheaper, and more versatile
  - need to prepare for the effects of digital on their firms
    - Ask what-if questions that assume more sales will come from digital, and most sales will be 
    heavily influenced by digital even if they occur in-store
- assume the system needs to be designed from scratch
- design specifications for the omnichannel retailer:
  - customers want all of the digital benefits:
    - broad selection
    - lots of product info
    - customer reviews & tips
  - customers also want all of the in-store benefits:
    - personal service
    - ability to touch products
    - shopping as an event / experience
- different segments may value pieces of the above list differently, but all retailers 
(traditional AND online) need to consider that customers want seamless integration of
the in-store and online experiences

### Bringing Digital and Physical Retailing Together ###
Advantages of Digital:
- tons of product info
- customer reviews & tips
- editorial content & advice
- two-way engagement
- massive selection
- convenient, fast checkout
- price comparison, special deals
- anything, anytime, anywhere access (convenience)

Advantages of Physical:
- edited assortment
- shopping for the experience and event
- easy to try on or experience products
- personalized help
- convenient returns
- immediate access to products
- help with setup or servicing ongoing repairs
- instant gratification of all sensory inputs

### Pathways and Pain Points ###
- 3 traditional retail imperatives:
  1. stock what you think customers will want
  2. build awareness of what's in the store
  3. make it enticing and easy for prospective customers to buy once they enter the store
- Omnichannel is more complex
  - products are more easily customized to individual needs
  - awareness is not entirely dependent on company efforts, but also on reviews, friend's recommendations
  - shopping experience is not limited to the store, but also based on research, hassle-free returns, etc...
- retailers now have a lot more tools available to create awareness (no longer just mass-market ads)
  - send coupon codes to mobile devices
  - optimize search terms, location-based promotions
  - send targeted offers to customers who check in to the store
  - etc...
- different segments can be targeted in different ways, impressing each in the process
- must research and identify pain points and unique paths for each segment in order to tailor solutions
for each segment (no more one-size-fits-all approach)

### The Experience of Shopping ###
- traditional retailers probably don't realize just how much online retailers have affected them
  - reduced volume of sales leads to cutting labor, reducing costs, and reducing level of service quality
  - such measures actually make the problem worse, as the lessened service further commoditizes stores rather
  than setting them apart, so the customers focus on price and convenience which online retailers hold
  the advantage in
- stores need to be turned from liabilities into assets, as physical stores are the one advantage that they have
over online retailers
  - stores actually boost online purchases according to research, so they can be helpful in an overall strategy
  - traditional stores are not sufficient, however
    - people will avoid shopping if they can help it, because it's a chore for many
    - if the shopping experience was changed to be more engaging, people might want to actually shop
    - physical stores could offer an experience unobtainable online
  - digital tech can provide new ways to engage, new ways to change pricing / promotions on the fly
    - customized recommendations
    - connect shoppers with friends who aren't present
    - eliminate checkout lines
    - speed up service
- improvements in physical retailer combined with an online retail strategy can create an effective omnichannel
experience that is better than a 100% digital approach
- such innovations need to be applied before competitors can, and with enough effect to make a difference
in consumer perceptions and actions
- learning how to appropriately test new innovations will be key, as lots of things will be hard to measure
and lots of approaches may fail

## The Omnichannel Organization ##
- one approach to creating a new omnichannel firm is to create separate organizations but make sure that key
decisions are coordinated effectively, unlike what happened in the 1990s
  - allows each company to maximize sales without worry about conflicts
  - eventually collaboration needs to increase over time to maximize synergy between units
- firms also need to get the right innovative talent
  - retailers must compete with Amazon, Google, etc... for this talent, and haven't been very good at attracting
  such talent
  - retailers may need to allow people to work wherever they want, since traditional division headquarters may
  be unattractive compared to Silicon Valley, etc...
- need to move quickly enough to respond to market changes, but slowly enough to test and learn to make sure 
changes are done right

## Is It All Worth It? ##
- a working omnichannel strategy should not only guarantee survival, it needs to fundamentally change customer
expectations in a revolutionary way
- digital and physical need to complement instead of compete in order to increase sales and reduce costs
- retailers need to take advantage of freely-flowing ideas from customers and employees
