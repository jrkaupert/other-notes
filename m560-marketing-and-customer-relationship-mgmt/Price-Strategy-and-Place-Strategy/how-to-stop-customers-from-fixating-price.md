# Notes from *How to Stop Customers from Fixating on Price* #
By Marco Bertini & Luc Wathieu

## Idea in Brief ##
- Heavy market competition causes commoditization, leading to a fixation on price by customers
- usually marketers mean diminishing differences among offerings to refer to commoditization
- commoditization is also psychological - consumers become less receptive to innovation or marketing
campaigns
- one of the best ways to revitalize consumer interest is price
- four strategies exist to price an offering to highlight its differences such that it's worth a premium

## Introduction ##
- even if companies think their products are distinct and deserve to command a premium, customers don't 
necessarily see things the same way automatically
- in a sea of many products, often price is the only thing influencing purchase decisions
- many markets are mature to the point where price competition is the norm
- sometimes price undercutting challenges companies to become more efficient, but it often kills brand equity
and profit margins
- customers start expecting less, and become disengaged, focusing solely on price and becoming desensitized to
marketing and innovations that aren't revolutionary
- price can actually be used to combat this issue, framing the quality and relevance of the product, to awaken
consumers to the value of an offering

## Strategy 1: Use Price Structure to Clarify Your Advantage ##
- use pricing to call attention to the biggest point of difference in your product
- structure pricing in a way consumers can understand, providing tiers of offerings at different price points
so consumers can understand the difference in value delivered
- price in a way that makes sense to the customer, units sold isn't always the best way to do it, but by
value delivered instead
- can price by "miles driven" or "hours used" instead to force consumers to evaluate the product in terms
of their own behavior rather than just looking for the cheapest option
- these methods provide personal relevance on the value provided to customers, removing the head-to-head
price competition

## Strategy 2: Willfully Overprice to Stimulate Curiosity ##
- moderate overpricing can breed curiosity: customers don't dismiss high-priced products outright, they
look to see if the features justify the added price
- prices that are too close to expectation or way too high will lead consumers to their natural price-sensitive
behavior
- for every product, there's a price range in which customers will ask themselves if they need the added 
benefits provided instead of stopping at looking for the cheapest option
- willful overpricing can allow companies to bring innovations into commodity markets without fear
- willful overpricing also helps customers pay attention, and improves their recall about the product

## Strategy 3: Partition Prices to Highlight Overlooked Benefits ##
- break a price into component charges rather than a single piece
- this approach can highlight different areas of differentiation that would otherwise not receive
attention
- people are not likely to factor benefits into decision making unless explicit charges are indicated
for it
  - people get annoyed if price partitioning is overused, especially on mandatory services that can't
  be avoided anyways, especially if such prices aren't revealed until part way through the transaction
  - highlighting standard features backfires, competitive advantages should be highlighted instead
- partitioning only succeeds when customers realize a benefit they wouldn't have noticed otherwise

## Strategy 4: Equalize Price Points to Crystallize Personal Relevance ##
- when customers are choosing between options that specifically appeal to differing tastes, all options
should be priced the same so that customers can find and choose the ones best suited to their
needs
  - in this case, they will appreciate the range of options and will not look to reduce features in
  favor of a lower price
- this approach is unusual for companies that use a cost-plus approach, since each product has
different costs, so higher cost products should command a higher price (based on the assumption 
of requiring a constant profit margin)
  - the cost-plus approach doesn't work well in mature markets because customers have become desensitized
  to small changes in value and no longer put in the effort to understand how different product options
  may benefit them, so they go with the lowest price
  - lists of options at different prices doesn't force customers to evaluate merits of options, only to 
  hone in on the price
- keeping prices the same removes price as a question altogether, instead forcing the customer to ask "which 
one of these is right for me?"
- low cost advantage companies may still prefer to keep price low for their own purposes, but most companies
would benefit from using price to force people to think about value offered
  - price combats disengagement because it's so important to customers
  - get customers to ask "What am I actually paying for?" and "What features of this product do I really need?"
