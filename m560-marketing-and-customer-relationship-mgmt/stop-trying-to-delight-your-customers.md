## Key Takeaways ##
Traditional belief has held that companies must "delight" their customers by
going above and beyond their expectations.  Studies have found that customers
rarely get a satisfactory solution to their actual need.

Focus on reducing customer effort to increase their repeat business and overall
loyalty.

Anticipate and proactively handle follow-up calls, manage emotional needs,
reduce the need for customers to switch to competitors, learn from unhappy
customers, and solve their problems without worrying about speed

## Forget the Bells and Whistles - Solve their problems ##
- Companies feel they must delight the customer, but customers rarely choose
a company because of such service
- Customers switch services all the time because of terrible service, however,
much more readily than rewarding good service, especially in phone-based and
self-service interactions
- Most companies aren't even offering basic service experience that matches
their promises

Findings from a massive study on the topic:
1. Delighting customers doesn't increase loyalty - reducing the effort required
to solve their problem does
2. Reducing effort to solve customer problems can improve overall customer
service, reduce costs, and reduce churn

## Trying too Hard ##
- The research doesn't pan out for customer loyalty to firms that try to exceed
expectations (only a marginal benefit over meeting their needs baseline)
- Even though most organizations strive for this, few customers actually
experience this "exceeded expectations" and report it
- The assumption that customer satisfaction implies loyalty is just not there
in study after study, however dissatisfaction does tend to lead to service
switching.  Service is most of what drives disloyalty.

## Make it Easy ##
- Just focus on making life easy for the customer, it gives front-line employees
a focus for their work
- Remove obstacles such as:
  1. Having to contact the company repeatedly to resolve the problem
  2. Having to repeat information
  3. Having to switch between service channels (ie: web to phone)
- Look at Customer Effort Score (CES) as a metric instead of Customer
satisfaction (CSAT)

First Contact Resolution (FCR) metrics may not be as effective in helping
reduce customer effort as tracking repeat callers

Some tactics to use:
1. Don't just resolve the current problem, prevent the next one
2. Prepare employees to handle the emotional side of interactions
3. Reduce switching by increasing self-service channel stickiness (guide them
  to the best channel for their needs/capabilities)
4. Use feedback from unhappy customers or ones having problems to reduce
overall customer effort
5. Empower employees to deliver a low-effort experience (quality over speed)

Phone-based may not be better than self-service, but either way the effort needs
to be reduced for the customer.
