# My Notes from *When Marketing IS Strategy* #

## Key takeaways ##
- Upstream stuff like sourcing, production, and logistics are becoming commodities
or outsourced increasingly
- Downstream stuff like managing customer perceptions and affecting their costs
and risks are becoming new ways to achieve competitive adv.
- biggest effects for product-based industries, maturing industries, and orgs
trying to move up the value chain


## Downstream strategy shift ##
- downstream activities that directly face the consumer are more and more the
reason why consumers pick one brand over another and remain loyal
  - ex: You buy a 24 pack of Coke at the store for ~25cents per can in advance,
  but are willing to pay $2 for a can on a hot day from a vending machine due
  to the convenience
- most companies are still focusing their strategy on reducing costs at the
point of production (maximizing throughput, efficiency, etc...), but the better
approach is to look not at what else can be done for production, but instead
for the customer
- The "new center of gravity" is "customers" and the "market"
  - Now competitive advantage comes from outside of the company, and increases
  with more experience and knowledge instead of decreasing over time
  - Competition changes: it's not about the better product, its about the needs
  of the customer and how you're positioned relative to their purchase criteria
  - customers and their changing purchase criteria now affect pace of the
  changes in market instead of technological innovation
- downstream competitive advantage focuses on customers, channel partners, and
related processes and sources of info on the market and customer behavior
- consider what would happen if Coke had to restart operations if:
  1. it lost all physical assets but maintained its brand reputation, vs.
  2. it lost its brand recognition but maintained its physical assets
- Focusing downstream creates "stickiness" that creates brand loyalty

## Should you listen to your customers? ##
- companies are finding more and more success not by responding to the stated
ideals of a customer, but instead by defining for the customer what they want
  - Steve Jobs: "It's not the consumers' job to know what they want."
- Even when consumers do know what they want, asking may not be the best way to
find out
- Market leaders set the bar for performance in their domain (Volvo for safety)
- Strategic goal = change how customers feel about existing purchase criteria
relative to one another, and create new, favorable criteria

## Does Competitive Advantage have to erode over time? ##
- For upstream-focused companies, as rivals catch up, comp. adv. erodes
- For downstream-focused companies, however, the advantage can actually
increase over time
  - Facebook's advantage is in the 1B users it has already, a huge downstream
  asset.  Network effects are highly related to downstream competitive advantage.  
  More users staying on Facebook means more friends staying.
  - difficult to replicate, distributed, exist in the marketplace
- Other downstream advantages:
  - reducing costs and risks for the customer (gathering and improving data
    allows for you to gather and improve more data to help your customer)

## Can you choose your competitors? ##
- When moving downstream, three decisions can alter who your competitors are:
  1. How you position your offering against competitors in the customer's mind
    - ex: Brita filters compete against other filters in the kitchen appliance
    section, but compete against bottled water where they have a cost adv.
    on the bottled water aisle
  2. How you position yourself agains the competition in the distribution
  channel
    - ex: Repackage differently than the competition to avoid looking like a
    commodity so that you're memorable against them
  3. Pricing
    - ex: Who are you competing with? The 5 series BMW or the 3 series?
- You have more of a say in determining your competition if you're a late
entrant instead of a first-to-market.  Can differentiate against the incumbent
instead of being at the mercy of later entrants
- Incumbents can redefine the market with new criteria of purchase, however on
a regular basis

## Does innovation always = better? ##
- Brands compete over relative importance of purchase criteria, but innovations
are more or less important depending on these relative criteria
- downstream focus should be on marketplace activities / processes such as
innovations that reduce customer costs and risks over the purchase/consumption/
disposal lifecycle
  - ex: Hyundai during the recession offered a risk-reduction to allow consumers
  to return cars within 1 year of purchase if they lost their job/income. Sold
  more cars than Chrysler despite 4x fewer dealerships
    - Hyundai innovated by selling cars better, not by selling better cars

## Is the pace of innovation set in the R&D labs? ##
- Not all technological innovations disrupt competitive advantage.  The shift
in purchase criteria is a bigger risk
- Three types of market change, each requiring more power to push the change
through the market than the previous:
  1. Evolutionary - push existing boundaries of purchasing criteria
  2. Generational - add new criteria that complement existing
  3. Revolutionary - New criteria that also obsolete the old criteria
- technological innovations are required to evolve markets, but the downstream
components are what move customers thru the changes

## Tilt ##
- Three types of companies are most affected by the "tilt" toward downstream
activities:
  1. Product-based industries
  2. Maturing industries becoming more and more commoditized
  3. Companies trying to move up the value chain (allow new forms of customer
    value/differentiation)
- Downstream focus puts value and competitive advantage in the marketplace
rather than inside the company
