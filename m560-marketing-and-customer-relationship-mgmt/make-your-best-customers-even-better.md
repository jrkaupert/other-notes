# Notes from *Make Your Best Customers Even Better* #
Article by Eddie Yoon, Steve Carlotti, & Dennis Moore

Superconsumers may be willing to buy even more of the product than they
currently do.  This may be an easier path to market growth than targeting
light users or lapsed users.

Think Pareto principle.  **Superconsumers are around 10% of customers but
may be 30-70% of sales and an even larger proportion of profits**

Rather than focusing strictly on keeping big spenders loyal, focus on
making them a part of growth plans.  They aren't necessarily maxed out.

This effect occurs outside of consumer goods too, in apparel, durables,
and even financial services.

Superconsumers are slightly different than heavy users (highest-volume
  buyers).  
- Superconsumers are more than quantity purchased, they are
both economics and attitude, more engaged with category and brand than
average.  
- They want new, innovative uses for the product, and variations on it
- not very price sensitive
- they have more reasons to pull the product out, and more uses for it
- Analytics are identifying these Superconsumers exist more than managers
previously believed

Superconsumers are an opportunity to drive sales growth.  They are easier
to reach because they're already buying, so ads/promotions are more
efficient
- direct and digital marketing more effective

Superconsumers may also provide insights that can be translated into
strategy for a product
- ideal for testing new product ideas
- may even source new ideas

Focusing superconsumers can be a revitalizing source of energy for
organizations that have older, slow-growth products

**Love the customers who love you the most**
