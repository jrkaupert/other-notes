## Introduction ##
Must understand internal and external marketing environments before you can
decide on marketing strategies.

## Using 5Cs Analysis to assess situation ##
5 key elements to the marketing environment:
1. Customers
2. Context
3. Company
4. Collaborators/Complementors
5. Competitors

### Analyzing Customers ###
1. Needs Analysis
  - Identify utilitarian, symbolic, emotional, and social needs the
  product fulfills for the customer
  - What functional need does the product fill?
  - How does it make the customer's life easier / better?
  - What meaning does the product bring into customer's life?
  - What rituals/traditions is the product a part of?
  - How does the product help build customer's identity?
  - How does the product connect customers to others socially and fulfill
  their social roles?
  - How does the product make consumers feel?
  - What emotions associated with the purchase/use of product?
  - Analyze direct/indirect benefits and pain/unhappiness/negatives
  - Don't forget irrational needs too, and needs a consumer may not even
  be consciously aware of

  - Segmentation / targeting decisions can be made from looking at needs
  across whole market.
    - Are needs homogenous or different?
    - Are needs currently being met by something else? If so, what?
    - How satisfied are consumers with current solutions?
    - What needs still unfulfilled by existing products?

2. Decision Making Process Analysis

  Need to understand how consumers identify their needs and the process
  they use to fulfill that need.  5 stages:
  1. Problem recognition
    - Analyze when, where, how the need arises
    - Analyze situational, social, marketing triggers informing consumers
    they have a problem needing solving
  2. Information search
    - Analyze sources of information used to understand options
    - Analyze social influences (friends, family, internet ratings, media
      celebrities)
    - Analyze social reference groups used to benchmark against
    - Analyze opinion leaders that matter to consumers
    - Analyze what marketing activities are effective at helping their
    search (website, salesman, point of purchase information, advertising)
  3. Evaluation of alternatives
    - Analyze which attributes/features are most important among brands &
    products
    - Analyze how do consumers make their decisions & factors influencing
    choice
    - Analyze how attributes are weighted against one another
    - Analyze if choices are cognitive or emotional
  4. Purchase decision
    - Analyze where consumers purchase the product
    - Analyze social/situational influences during the purchase
    - Analyze what happens at the place of purchase to influence whether
    or not they buy
  5. Post Purchase evaluation
    - Analyze how consumers assess if their purchase was the right
    product
    - Analyze how the product is used in everyday life
    - Analyze if the product is for the purchaser or someone else
    - Analyze satisfaction after using the product, and any regrets

### Analyzing Context ###
Six external environments to consider:
1. Demographic
  - current & future direction of population in a market
  - census & other data provide trends
  - how can total population be split into segments by:
    - age
    - generation
    - family structure
    - race
    - ethnicity
    - social class
    - gender
    - educational level
    - geographical location
  - What segments exist in the population?
  - how big is each segment and which are growing/shrinking?
  - How do segments differ from one another, and what's the significance
    of such differences?
2. Economic
  - Macro/Microeconomic conditions affecting consumers
  - Market economy strong/weak?
  - Consumer confidence and how it's trending over time
  - Economic factors such as unemployment, inflation, debt, and their
  effects on consumer confidence
  - Income dispersion
  - Which segments have enough purchasing power to buy today and which
  are likely to in the future?
3. Socio-cultural
  - What factors such as worldviews, political/social ideologies, value
  systems, traditions, rituals, fashions, and tastes are important and
  which are not currently?
  - Which are likely to prevail as trends, and which are likely to pass
  away as fads?
  - What does the culture value?
  - What do subcultures of the market value?
4. Political/legal
    - Which laws & policies enable growth or hinder potential in
    different markets?
    - What laws govern the industry?
    - How do laws vary by country?
    - How do consumer advocacy groups & safety organizations affect the
    market?
    - What changes might occur given political shifts?  
5. Technological
  - How does tech affect consumers and their needs and buying habits?
  - How is tech shaping types of products desired?
  - How is tech shaping how consumers make decisions and shop?
  - Which tech products are consumers using, and how do these products
  change how consumers live their lives?
  - How is tech changing media habits?
  - What new tech is upcoming and how might it shape future business or
  market conditions?
6. Natural
  - customer connection to and concern for the natural world
  - How product and operations affect and are reliant upon the
  environment
  - How is the natural environment changing?
  - What impact do environmental changes have on operations and ability
  to get raw materials?
  - How does the product itself affect the environment?
  - How important do consumers view the natural environment, and what
  perceptions do they have of the firm and its products relative to
  environmental concerns?


- After looking at each environment, translate the info into strategic
implications.  
- Identify opportunities and challenges to the business based on these
environments.  
  - What enables/limits possibilities?
  - How are market segment opportunities changing due to shifts in these
  environments?
  - How might such shifts improve/reduce competitive advantages?
  - How do these shifts affect needs of the customer and the business'
  ability satisfy such needs?

### Analyzing Company ###
Analysis of Business Model & Competitive Strategy
- What does the company do, and how does it make money?
- What makes the business run?
- What is the competitive strategy?
  - Low cost leader?
  - Differentiation?
  - Niche?


Competitive Advantage Analysis
- What can the company do that is of value to customers that competitors
cannot match? Is this advantage sustainable over time?
- What makes the firm & its products unique?
  - Differentiation in products/services?
  - Marketing advantages (advertising efficiencies via larger market
    share, larger marketing budget, etc...)
  - Brand already established with brand equity value?
  - Key existing relationships with customers?
  - Key existing relationships with complementors?
  - Better R&D?
  - Better employees?  

### Analyzing Collaborators & Complementors ###
**Collaborators** = companies/people who help a firm market product
to customers
- Suppliers
- Distributors
- Retailers
- Influencers who spread the word
  - Doctors
  - The media
  - Bloggers

**Complementors** = companies/people who also benefit when the firm
sells its product
- Other companies who sell complementary products


Need to analyze the following:
- strength of each collaborator/complementor relationship
  - Which are strong enough to leverage?
  - Which may be threatened by decisions facing the firm?
  - which need more work to ensure mutual success?
- How can the firm provide more value to collaborators/complementors
- How does firm's product help partners achieve their goals?
  - How can this be used to motivate partners to help build your own
  business?

### Analyzing Competitors ###
Identification and analysis of companies competing with a firm is
critical. Companies that deliver similar or alternate solutions to a
firm's products must be understood in the following ways:
- Business models, competitive strategies, competitive advantages,
marketing strategies of competitors
- Which firms are leaders, followers, niche players?
- Which segment does each competitor target?
- How is each competitor positioned in the marketplace?
- What strategies and tactics does each competitor employ in marketing?
- How do each competitor's products compare to the firm's?
- How do price points compare?
- How do marketing budgets compare?
- How does each competitor interact with consumers?
- What distribution channels are used by each competitor?
- How has market share changed recently and what factors led to this?
- What are major strengths and weaknesses of competitors and how could
these be exploited?
- How do the opportunities/constraints of the marketplace affect your
own company differently than competitors?

## Using Porter's 5 Forces to understand industry competitiveness ##
What are the dynamics of the industry in which the firm competes?
- Calculate size, market share, sales, profitability of competitors
- Five key forces:
  1. Competitors
  2. Potential Entrants
  3. Availability of Substitutes
  4. Buyer Power
  5. Supplier Power


The 5 forces create profitability potential for the industry and its
competing firms, and significantly affect marketing strategy

### Industry Competitors ###
- less competition is generally better
- high competition leads to:
  - profit-reducing price wars
  - higher advertising / marketing expenses
  - frequent new product introductions
- It's expensive to compete with strong, aggressive competitors
- what does it take to compete successfully in the industry, and what
level of profitability is required given competitive pricing/cost
dynamics?

### Potential Entrants ###
- New entrants raise competitiveness of an industry=
- Industries unattractive to new firms are more valuable than those
bringing in lots of new firms
- High entry barriers and low exit barriers are favorable

### Availability of Substitutes ###
- substitutes can shift customers demand to alternative products than
your own
- substitutes tend to:
  - reduce price point
  - increase need for marketing expenses
  - reduce industry profitability
- perfect substitutes (commodities) make for bad industries to compete in
- In the absence of differentiation, customers buy from the lowest price
competitor, so all other competitors cannot profitably compete

### Buyer Power ###
- buyer power affects profitability
- buyers can be:
  - end users of product
  - retailers
  - middlemen
- buyers have power over a firm when:
  - they are price-sensitive
  - they have substitutes
  - they face low switching costs
  - they organize into collective buying units
  - they share pricing information amongst each other
  - they become able to produce the product themselves
- firms facing powerful buyers
  - have less ability to control prices
  - must provide more value to buyers and keep them satisfied
  - have less negotiating ability

### Supplier Power ###
- supplier power also determines profitability
- suppliers include:
  - firms supplying raw materials
  - employees supplying labor to make products
- powerful suppliers can:
  - raise prices
  - limit supply of goods necessary to build product
- suppliers are powerful when:
  - they offer materials with no substitutes
  - they are concentrated
  - they can make the product themselves for direct sale to consumers
  - switching costs are high
- firms facing powerful suppliers
  - have less negotiating ability
  - pay higher prices which raises cost structure

## Summing it all up in a SWOT Analysis ##
- How do internal conditions contribute to firm's strengths and
weaknesses?
- How do external conditions provide opportunities and threats to firm's
business model?

SWOT analysis gives snapshot of current situation of the firm.
- Should cull the analysis of 5C's and 5 forces to the most significant,
strategically important factors for the business.
- Should synthesize and generalize previous analyses to identify
patterns, so priorities can be established

A marketing plan should build on strengths, mitigate weaknesses, exploit
key opportunities, and avoid major threats.

### External Origin ###
External opportunities and threats which a firm cannot control, but
to which it must respond
- Opportunities
  - New customer needs
  - opening access to new markets
  - new technologies to save costs and enhance profits
  - any favorable trend/development that may benefit the firm's
  operations
  - the firm cannot affect opportunities, but may take advantage of them
- Threats
  - closing access to markets
  - increasing competition in industry
  - decreased desire and value for a product
  - any unfavorable trends/developments that may reduce sales or profit
  or prevent firm from pursuing opportunities
  - firm cannot affect threats, but can change strategy to avoid negative
  effects of them

### Internal Origin ###
Internal strengths and weaknesses are internal to the firm or under
its control
- Strengths
  - Unique resources/circumstances that can be used to take advantage of
  opportunities
  - Core competencies / capabilities superior to competition that are
  relevant to customers
  - firms should focus on developing proficiency in areas that are
  relevant, important, and valuable to customers, and that help compete
- Weaknesses
  - core competencies/capabilities that are inferior to competition
  - areas in which the firm is deficient
  - firms should strive to improve capabilities in these areas when
  valuable and important to customers, and where at a disadvantage to
  the competition
  - split into required competencies (stuff customers require) vs.
  distinctive competencies (may provide unique advantages)
  - required competencies need to be addressed to just stay in the game
  - distinctive competencies need to be addressed to beat the competition

## Ongoing Market Scanning ##
Initial analysis can be the baseline for future analysis to understand
how environments are changing.
1. What can be learned from the past?
  - Successes/failures?
  - Competitor successes/failures?
  - What can be learned from these?
2. How can we better assess the present?
  - What consumer information is not currently being used to make
  decisions? Think online brand communities, consumer product ratings,
  consumer complaints, sales force input.
  - What companies outside firm's sector are succeeding and what do they
  do well?
  - What best practices can be mimicked?
3. How can we prepare for the future?
  - What might happen in the future to the firm, its customers,
  collaborators, or competitors?
  - What emerging trends are other companies following?
  - What can be tested today to learn for tomorrow?
  - What is the firm most dependent on and what would happen if these
  disappeared?

## Using these tools to guide Marketing Decisions ##
Analysis from 5Cs, Porter's 5 Forces, and SWOT feed into strategy/tactic
decisions.

Some examples of how marketing decisions are affected by these analyses:
- Segmentation / Target Market Decisions:
  - 5Cs customer section offers segmentation info
  - 5Cs competition section shows where competitors are focusing, so
  managers can pick a unique and profitable target market
- Branding Decisions:
  - 5Cs company section provides input on brand equity a firm has already
  - 5Cs competitive section provides competitor brand equity info to
  evaluate strengths/weaknesses against others
- Positioning Decisions:
  - 5Cs company section shows competencies of firm to differentiate in
  the marketplace
  - 5Cs competition section shows positioning of competitors to identify
  parity and differences
  - 5Cs customer section identifies what customers value so positioning
  statements can be evaluated
- Product Decisions:
  - 5Cs company section shows product-related firm competencies
  - 5Cs competition section shows product features/benefits from other
  firms
  - 5Cs customer section provides ideas on what customers care about
  so product feature additions can be understood
- Pricing Decisions:
  - Porter's 5 forces analysis helps here.  Industry profitability and
  competitive dynamics directly affect, and
  buyer/supplier/rivalry/substitutes/new entrants directly affect how
  much power company has to set prices
- Distribution Decisions:
  - Porter's 5 forces buyer power section considers company buyer
  relationships, which may include retailers.  Companies with power
  over retailer relationships may have more shelf space and can
  offer better promotional deals
  - 5Cs complementor section affects strategic planning for distribution
  since it considers distributor partners and their needs
- Promotion Decisions:
  - 5Cs customer section identifies customer decision process, which
  indicates points where company can interact with customer
  - Media habits can show where, when, and how to interact
