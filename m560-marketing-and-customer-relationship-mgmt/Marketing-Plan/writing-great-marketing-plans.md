# Notes from *Writing Great Marketing Plans* #
From *Writing Great Marketing Plans* by Tim Calkins

Great marketing plans are required if you want to execute and deliver amazing
results.

Ideas get translated to action in a plan.

Summary:
- Market strategy development never ends
- Once you start executing the plan, you have to analyze the situation and
create new plans
  - If things are working, how can you further improve?
  - If things are not working, how can you fix them?

## 1 - Why care about writing great plans? ##
**Marketing Plan** = document laying out recommendations for a business
- Describes what you hope to accomplish and will do
  - objectives
  - strategies
  - tactics
- Written for 2 reasons
  1. Communicate a plan
  2. Gain support
- Executive is responsible, but best created with a cross-functional team
- May take different forms: written, presentations, memos
- Usually written once a year

Typical organization of a plan:
1. Situation analysis (50-100 pages).  May contain pricing trends,
competitive promotion plans, volume and share trends, historical
advertising strategy, etc...
2. The plan itself, including many ideas
3. Financial section with trends and other info.  Variable margin trends,
product cost trends, marketing spending by type, projects, etc...
4. A section of miscellany.  Ethnic programs, risk, timing of key
decisions, etc...

Benefits of being able to write good plans:
1. Gain support for recommendations. Good plans simple, clear, convincing
2. It becomes easier to write plans as you write more of them. Become
more efficient over time
3. Helps deliver better results. Writing refines ideas and focus. Leads
to productive discussions that improve the plan and its delivered results

Plans need to be founded upon understanding of brand and customer.  Cannot
skip the research, nor the execution of the plan.

## 2 - The process ##
Four parts to the marketing planning process:
1. Understand the situation
  - brand
  - market
  - competition
2. Develop the plan
  - objectives
  - strategies
  - tactics
3. Write and present the plan, & gain support
  - should not be a part of the analysis phase, nor the strategy creation
  process
4. Execute

Once all four steps are complete, start over with step 1 re-understanding
the new situation

Marketing plans are recommendations, not reference pieces or reports

Marketing plans should offer a strong recommendation with compelling
support, but not all of the analysis that led to the recommendation

### Elements ###
Objectives = goals for the business
- What is the plan trying to achieve?
- Often given by senior management
- Should always be a financial objective in a marketing plan (usually
  profit)
- May also include another objective on how the business will achieve
  the financial goal (ex: grow profit by x% while also building market
  share)
- Don't want too many objectives. Focus on one or two.

Strategies = key initiatives
- What does the team need to do to deliver the desired objectives?
- Action-oriented, not theories, values, or principles
  - Good: entering new markets, launching products, changing price
  - Bad: innovation, quality, teamwork (good things, not strategies)
- Limit to 3-4 strategies to maintain focus and keep them memorable

Tactics = detailed programs to execute strategies
- 3-4 tactics for each strategy
- specific actions to make the strategy happen

Objectives -> Strategies -> Tactics (Everything must be linked!)

**Summarize objectives, strategies, and tactics on one page**
- may use a visual representation of blocks for each

### Writing the Plan ###
1. Construct the framework skeleton to build the plan around
  - Find the story / flow of the document
2. Fill in the details
  - Add the support & explain why each recommendation makes sense
3. Once a full draft, revise
  - Remove unnecessary stuff
  - Add data to improve the recommendations
4. Revise again
  - improve the flow

## 3 - Keys to Success ##
1. You are selling a recommendation.  Don't forget that.
  - Want to gain support for ideas
  - Communicate the plan, AND explain why it's the best plan
  - anticipate questions & reasons why someone would NOT support the
  plan, and proactively address these
  - Use facts to support, noting source, time, and specific measures
  - Make the data compelling
  - Deal with any conflicting data proactively
2. Tell a story.
  - People remember stories
  - answer questions from previous page with the next page
3. Keep it simple.
  - try to make things seem simple and obvious
  - focus on objective and key strategies
  - use threes.  Two seems to light, four or more seems too much and
  people may not remember
  - avoid complex charts and graphs.  Find the simplest way to make the
  point
  - Use introductions and conclusions, and agendas.
  - Avoid more than five bulleted points on a page
