# My Notes from *The Ultimate Marketing Machine* #

## Key takeaways ##
- best orgs are:
  - using customer insights
  - communicating a purpose
  - providing great customer experience
  - collaborating cross-functionally
  - executing with strategic focus, agility, and training
  - using new fluid org structures

## Marketing has changed rapidly over the past decade ##
- possibly more than any area other than IT
- stuff becomes obsolete after only a few years
- despite this, the org structure of marketing hasn't changed for over 40 years
ago when brand management hit
  - CMOs finding it difficult how to draw new charts
  - instead of this, look at:
    - Values and goals driving brand strategy
    - Capabilities that promote market excellence
    - What structures and processes support the first two things? ie: strategy
    leads to structure instead of the other way around
- Unite around the purpose, goals, and process to achieve purpose/goals
before worrying about reorg

## Winning characteristics ##
- Insights from data
  - Best orgs integrate data of *what* consumers are doing with *why*,
  leveraging this to find new ways to meet their needs
  - Basic drives / "universal human truths" used to understand consumers
- Positioning
  - best orgs hit on all three parts of brand purpose
    1. functional benefits - the functions served by the item/brand being bought
    such as the caffeine boost from Starbucks
    2. emotional benefits - the emotional fulfillment offered by the brand, such
    as Starbucks being a social experience
    3. societal benefits - Stuff like sustainability, where Starbucks sources
    its coffee via fair trade, etc...
  - Strong and clear brand provides enhanced alignment across the organization
  and consistent messaging to employees and consumers
- Comprehensive experience
  - Best orgs are improving value to consumers by "creating customer
  experiences"
    - Personalized offerings by leveraging what the org knows about the consumer
    - More breadth by offering more ways to interact with the consumer
    (touchpoints)

## Organizing for Growth ##
- Marketing is too critical now to be left to just Marketing in an org
- All employees must have the same vision

Five drivers of organizational effectiveness:
1. Connect marketing to business strategy and rest of organization (builds
  trust)
2. Inspire the org by showing purpose of the brand to everyone in the org (
  strengthens commitment)
3. Focus on a small number of critical priorities (ensures success of strategy)
4. Organize agile, cross-functional teams
  - new types of roles are emerging in 3 categories: "thinkers" that do
  analytical tasks, "doers" that create content and designs, and "feelers" who
  handle engagement and interaction
  - CMOs and other leadership now must orchestrate projects across these 3 roles
  and provide necessary resources
5. Develop critical internal capabilities for success
  - marketers need traditional marketing / comms knowledge, but also additional
  training to dig deeper into the consumer
  - some companies using "reverse-mentoring" to bring execs up to speed on
  social media
  - worst orgs underinvest in training, compared to the best orgs
