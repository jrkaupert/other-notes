## Key Takeaways ##
Companies have cared about touchpoints (places they interact with customers
before, during, and after purchases) for a long time, but the focus has been
on maximizing satisfaction at these points.  This focus incorrectly projects
the idea that customers are happier than they actually are, and misses the
customer's end-to-end experience.  

Companies should use top-down judgment and bottom-up data-driven analysis to
look at redesiging the entire customer journey.  This requires moving from a
silo approach to a more cross-funcitonal one, and from a touchpoint view to a
journey one

Good journeys tend to be good for revenue growth based on pay TV and insurance
industry studies.  This is better at predicting business success than touchpoint
performance.

Even when customer experience problems don't exist, the journey concept can
be applied as a competitive differentiator of a company

## Customer Experience ##
- The context of any customer call about a product is important.  A call about
ensuring service continuity between moves is different than the handling of
contract renewal is different than trying to fix technical issues
- Companies should focus not only on each interaction, but also on the overall
customer journey and broader reasons for calls so that root causes can be
handled and feedback can be provided at all levels of the organization
- Companies that can do this gain major benefits:
  - improved customer satisfaction
  - reduced churn
  - higher revenues
  - better employee satisfaction
  - better collaboration across the organization

- Perfecting touchpoint interactions is insufficient to keep customers happy:
customers may be unhappy with the overall experience even if they are happy
at each touchpoint
- The aggregate experience across multiple touchpoints may be the big factor

- replacing touchpoints altogether isn't the solution, because different groups
have necessary expertise and insight can be gained from each touchpoint
- Companies should look at different customer journeys, which ones they need to
be the best at, and look to reimplement their approach cross-functionally to
support the new journeys.  Organizational culture changes must occur in parallel

## Identifying Key Journeys ##
- Identify the most important journeys and associated pain points.  Which pain
points are the worst?  Typical:
  - Dissatisfaction with installation process
  - Churn when customers move houses
  - Cancellation before or within 90 days of installation
- Top down work can produce some early wins that allow future growth toward
supporting these new journey experiences
- Roadmaps need to be defined to carry out the transformation over time, which
requires more bottom-up data-driven work of researching customer experiences and
identifying the ones that matter and ones that don't.
  - Consider customer surveys as well as employee surveys in tandem with actual
  operational data
  - May be able to use regression or other models to tease out relationships to
  identify which journeys should be prioritzed

## Understanding Current Performance ##
- Once the key journeys are known, each one must be further researched for
root cause Understanding
- Focus groups, call monitoring, etc... can provide details of the likely steps
that are possible from start to finish of the process
- Check the incentives offered to employees as well.  Some problems can be
handled inside the company rather than at the customer

## Redesigning the Experience and Engaging the Front Line ##
- Executives should avoid pushing for solutions that aren't driven by employees,
even if the fix seems obvious.  Cross-functional teams should drive the solution
because often issues arise from disconnects between groups, and this will
increase the likelihood that all groups buy-in to the solution
- Pilot projects can be implemented to test early solutions

## Sustaining at Scale by Changing Mind-sets ##
For success across the firm, two major changes are needed:
1. The organization and its processes need to change to deliver the new journeys
2. Metrics and incentives need to be shifted to support journeys and not just
touchpoints

- Creation of cross-functional organizational structures is likely necessary,
while existing functional structures can be maintained
- May need leadership in the interim to drive such change
- May help to design cross-functionality into all business processes, including
elements of authority and metrics and performance expectations
