# Notes from *Rediscovering Market Segmentation* #
Article by Daniel Yankelovich & David Meer

## Idea in Brief ##
Segmentation usually targets "consumer types", which may help in branding
identity to create messages that focus on different consumer groups.
- this approach doesn't tell companies which products/services consumers
will actually buy, however, so it doesn't help with creation of new
products/services

Instead, try the following:
1. Choose segmentation based on a strategic decision
2. Identify segments based on actual purchasing behavior (heaviness of use,
brand loyalty), and on likely behavior
3. Redefine segments as the environment changes

Doing the above will result in better agility in adapting to market
conditions and provide information on how to compete.  It also maximizes
utilization of marketing resources

## Idea in Practice ##
1. Identify a strategic decision that would be more effective with
information about different market segments
2. Identify which customers are driving profits
- why are the best customers the best?
- what segments include some of the same elements?
3. Look at actual and possible buying behaviors
- current behaviors (usage, loyalty, channel selection) can predict future
behaviors via conjoint analysis
  - show consumers various mixes of product features and ask how willingness
  to buy would vary if features added/removed, or price changed
  - segment based on results
4. Segment in practical ways that can be sold to senior management
- avoid getting too fine (and unlikely)
- pick intuitive segments to maximize buy-in for funding
5. Change the segmentations as the environment changes
- needs and behaviors can change rapidly (unlike personality traits)
- be able to resegment as necessary

## Main Article ##
Psycographic profile used in market segmentation is not really that useful.
Instead, identify customers that can have their behaviors changed, or ones
with unmet needs.

Market segmentation has been too narrowly focused on serving advertising
needs (focusing on commercials that have characters the audience
identifies with)

Psychographics can identify some of the realities of lifestyles, attitudes,
self-image, and future aspirations, but do not do well at predicting
likely purchases.

Good segmentation should provide understanding of groups most worth
focusing on.
- under-served
- dissatisfied
- possible first-time buyers
- etc..

**gravity of decision spectrum** = tool focusing on relationship of consumers to
a product or product category instead of psychographics.
- tells how deeply consumer motives, concerns, and psyches need to be probed
- on the shallow end, products offer savings of time, effort & money;
  - price sensitivity, habits, and impulsiveness might be good measures
- middle of the spectrum (cars, electronics) deal with quality, complexity,
and status
- deepest end, great emotional investment and core values are in play
  - health care, retirement homes, etc...

In the 1970's psychographics was shown to be effective for brand reinforcement
and positioning, but did little to affect purchasing

Despite being extremely widespread in use, marketing segmentation has been
found to provide little value to organizations in practice.

Useful segmentations require identifying patterns in customer's actual buying
habits
- which features and benefits matter to the customer?
- which customers will pay more? which demand lower prices?
- What advantages/disadvantages do customers perceive in existing offerings?
- what trends are happening right now (social, economic, tech) that may alter
purchasing or usage?

Once you have the customer data, you will find segments that:
- fit within the company's strategy
- show where revenues or profits may lie
- describe consumer values, attitudes, and beliefs related to products/services
- describe actual customer behavior
- are understandable to senior management
- fit within marketplace / consumer changes

> "Effective segmentations focus on just one or two issues, and they need to be
redrawn as soon as they have lost their relevance.""

The three major failures of traditional segmentation:
1. Too much focus on consumer identity (distracts from product features that
  matter)
2. Too little focus on actual customer behaviors (provide actual info about
  their attitudes and what they will likely do)
3. Too much obsession with technical elements of creating segments (makes it
  difficult / opaque for senior management who has to buy in)
