# Notes from *Keep Up with Your Quants* #
Article by Thomas H. Davenport

## Introduction ##
- Analytics are more and more of a necessity in the competitive business
environment now, but having big data isn't enough.
- Companies require managers that can work with quantitative people to make sure
that the analysis can be leveraged into strategic/tactical decisions

## You, the Consumer ##
- General managers (especially non-quantitative ones) should consider themselves
as consumers of analytics.
- Quants are the producers
- Analyses and models (the product) needs to be integrated with business
experience & intuition for decision making
- Most quants are great at gathering data and making predictions, but cannot
adequately hypothesize or identify relevant variables related to shifting
business conditions
- Managers (as data consumers) must generate hypotheses and identify if the
model results, predictions, and recommendations are relevant to the overall
business setting

## Learn a little about analytics ##
Learn some:
- basic regression analysis
- statistical inference
- experimental design
- process for making analytical decisions
- understanding of assumptions in models that quants should be able to defend

> No matter how much you trust your quants, don't stop asking them tough
questions.

## Align yourself with the right kind of quant ##
- Making analytics decisions is often about relationships more than the math
- everyone gets more out of the process if there is trust that allows two
way sharing of information and ideas

## Analytics-based decision making - 6 steps ##
1. Identify the problem
2. Investigate previous approaches
3. Make a model and select variables
4. Gather data
5. Analyze, rinse, and repeat until something useful is found
6. Tell a story with the data so people take action

## Focus on the beginning and the end ##
- How the problem is framed, and examining how others may have approached in the
past is critical, and is where experience and intuition are most relevant.
- The presentation and communication of results to other managers is also key
  - what's the best approach to appeal to the audience
  - be straightforward, and don't use too much technical jargon
  - ROI stories are typical and helpful

## Ask lots of questions along the way ##
- Ask smart people equally smart questions about the models and assumptions in
them along the way
- never stop asking questions
  - What was the source of the data?
  - How well do the sample data represent the population?
  - What about outliers, and how do they affect results?
  - What are the assumptions of the analysis, and what conditions might render
  the assumptions and model invalid?
  - Why was this analytical approach chosen, and what alternatives were
   considered?
  - What's the likelihood that the independent variables are actually causing
  the changes in the dependent variables?  Would other analyses identify
  a causal relationship more clearly?

## Establish a culture of inquiry, not advocacy ##
- Don't pressure quants to find evidence to support an idea, FIND THE TRUTH!
- Ask analysts to be the devil's advocate, rather than appeasing the leader

## When it all adds up ##
- You can't ignore analytics anymore, so it's critical to start becoming
data-savvy
