# Notes from *Data's Credibility Problem* #
Article by Thomas C. Redman

## Summary ##
**Problem:** lots of time is wasted on looking for data,
finding and fixing errors, and looking for confirmatory
info on untrusted data

**Cause:** People making the data don't know how others in the firm use it, and
people using data typically work around errors or fix as they go instead of
dealing with root causes of mistakes

**Solution:** Not more or better tech.  Need more comms between creators and
users of data, and responsibility from line managers with an interest in making
sure the data is right, not on IT people

## Introduction ##
- Data quality is a problem for most departments at all levels of a firm
- Employees often work around or fix errors as they go, but this wastes a lot
of time
- Errors that do make it through can have serious consequences
  - Kill a patient from incorrect lab measurements
  - Add millions to manufacturing costs via inaccurate specs
- Unreliable data reduces management trust, and causes them to revert to
intuition for decisions, direction, and strategy

## Connect Data Creators with Data Customers ##
- Only two points matter for data quality:
  1. when the data is created (quality fixed at this point)
  2. when the data is used (we judge the quality here)
- better to identify root cause so the problems go away rather than fix them
every time they show up (leaving them to be everyone's problem)
- people fixing the data may not be as qualified to fix the data as the
originators either
- communication can help between creators and users of data
- small investments can make huge impacts, just communicate!

## Focus on Getting New Data Right ##
- instead of cleaning up bad data, try to focus on improving the creation of
new data
- cleaning up data is not value-added
- rather than call bad records "partially good", consider them "entirely bad"
to illustrate the true magnitude of the problem
- give people targets, but don't tell them how to meet it

> Rather than launch a massive effort to clean up existing bad data, companies
should focus on improving the way new data are created.

## Put Responsibility on Line Managers ##
- Usually the ones creating data are not directly linked by organizational
ties to the users
- Often the IT department is tasked with fixing errors created by other groups
  - This often fails, because data quality is determined the moment it is
  created (usually NOT in IT)
  - IT doesn't gain much reward, nor does it feel the pain for bad data
- responsibility should be placed on data creators and the internal users
- Biggest barriers are often management not admitting their data isn't good
enough, or that people don't know how to fix bad data
- Senior leadership must be committed to company-wide, rather than siloed
initiatives

## Fixing the Metadata ##
- Lots of problems with data quality come from issues in metadata (data about
  data).
- Units of measure can cause problems
- Good metadata simplifies finding the needed data, being able to combine it,
and being able to draw conclusions from it
- Errors in metadata can have enormous consequences
- Can use common business terms used by a firm to develop key metadata
foundation
