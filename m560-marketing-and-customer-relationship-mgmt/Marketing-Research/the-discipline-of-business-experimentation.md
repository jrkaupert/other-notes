# Notes from *The Discipline of Business Experimentation* #
Article by Stefan Thomke & Jim Manzi

## Summary ##
**Problem:** Managers use experience, intuition, or conventional wisdom to
guide decisions when there isn't data available to help, and often these
aren't relevant

**Solution:**  Rigorous experiments separating independent variables from
dependent variables to identify possible cause-effect relationships should be
performed

**Guidance:** Companies should make sure experiments have a clear purpose, and
that stakeholders will actually change their behavior based on the results, as
well as that the experiment is even feasible, can be reliable, and that the
firm will get as much as possible out of the experiment

## Introduction ##
- big data can provide clues on past behavior, but not on how customers will
react to massive changes
- for innovation, data may not provide the insights required for decision-making,
but intuition, experience, and conventional wisdom may be no better
- experiments may provide some insights, however
- Why don't companies perform experiments more often?
  - reluctance to fund proper experiments
  - difficulty in execution
  - most tests too informal and not based in science and statistics, leading
  to bad decisions

## Does the Experiment Have a Clear Purpose? ##
- experiments should only be run if they answer very specific questions that
cannot be answered by other means
- must decide what you want to learn before deciding if an experiment is
appropriate
  - weak hypotheses without independent variables lead to weak results
  - must look at possible side effects too, which may be positive or negative,
  including cannibalization of more profitable items/methods

## Have Stakeholders Committed to Abiding by Results? ##
- stakeholders must be in agreement on what will happen once the results are
known
- DON'T cherry-pick the data
- be willing to walk away from something that's not supported by the data

## Checklist for Running Business Experiments ##
1. Purpose
  - does the experiment center on a specific action under consideration by
  management?
  - what do we want to learn?
2. Buy-in
  - What changes would be made based on results?
  - How do we ensure results aren't ignored?
  - How does the experiment fit into the overall learning agenda and strategy?
3. Feasibility
  - Does it have a testable prediction?
  - What is the required sample size? Is it sufficient to predict the desired
  magnitude of effect?
  - Can the firm feasibly conduct the experiment at test locations for the
  required duration?
4. Reliability
  - What measures will be used to handle bias (conscious or unconscious)?
  - Do the control groups resemble the test groups?
  - Can the experiment be done blind or double-blind?
  - Can other biases be eliminated via statistical analysis / techniques?
  - Would others replicating the test produce similar results?
5. Value
  - Has a targeted rollout to highest potential markets for payback been
  considered?
  - Have only the components with highest projected ROI been implemented?
  - Has the firm learned something about cause-effect relationships?

## Is the Experiment Doable? ##
- Experiments MUST have testable predictions!
  - can be very difficult to determine cause-effect due to complexity and
  quantity of variables in the business world (high causal density)
  - environment is changing too, which further complicates things
- companies should consider if it's feasible to have a sample large enough
to average out effects of all variables other than those being studied, but this
is often not possible due to costs or required changes in operations
  - larger samples do not necessarily lead to better data though
- required sample size dictated largely by magnitude of desired effect
  - small effects require large samples to study, larger effects require
  smaller samples to study
- optimal sample size can also reduce costs of testing

## How can we Ensure Reliability in Results? ##
- Randomized field trials (split sample into two subgroups randomly and apply
  test to one, control to other)
  - the subgroups must share characteristics, not be different (the stuff
    we aren't testing cannot be the control)
  - don't compare the best stores to the worst stores!
- Blind tests
  - blind tests prevent the Hawthorne effect, where participants may modify
  their behavior when they know they are part of the experiment
  - double-blind tests are not practical often in business settings
- Big data
  - specialized algorithms and multiple big data sets can offset limitations of
  small sample sizes that violate statistical method requirements
  - analysis can also help correct biases, failures of randomization, and other
  flaws in the experiment
- repeatability is king

## How can Big Data Help? ##
- to filter out statistical noise and identify cause-effect relationships,
samples must typically be in the thousands, but this may be expensive or
impossible
- an alternative can use big data and other techniques to allow for smaller
samples to be used to glean info

## Have We Gotten the Most Value Out of the Experiment? ##
- lots of companies perform experiments but really don't get as much as possible
from them
- focus should be placed on areas where the payback possibilities are highest
  - ask "What works where?"
- implement just the components of a program that create value in excess of the
costs

## Challenging Conventional Wisdom ##
- experiments that are repeatable can allow a company to challenge conventional
wisdom, such as pricing things at points other than .49 or .99
