# Markstrat Handbook Notes #

**Overall Objective: Maximize Share Price Index (SPI), which includes net
contribution generated, product market share, revenue growth, and quality
of projects completed**

## Suggested teaming considerations ##
- Initially, have everyone participate in all areas & discussions
- Eventually, have specific members focus specific areas

## The Markstrat World ##
- All firms start with 2 brands

### Clinite Products ###
Clinites = skin-care cosmetics, have been out for several years and had
consistent market growth and predicted future market growth

5 major characteristics of Clinites:
1. Efficacy = how well does it deliver the intended benefit?
2. Safety = to what degree does it produce side-effects?
3. Packaging = packaging traits, including attractiveness, convenience to carry,
size, etc...
4. Pleasure = how pleasing is the product to use?
5. Usability = ease of use, time to dry, number of uses needed per day, etc...

Product characteristics rated 10 (poor) to 100 (excellent)
- Offering more of a given characteristic is not necessarily better (high
  safety for a suntan product prevents tanning, thus lower might be better)

Base cost = cost at which each unit is produced based on initial batch of 2.5M
units.  Starts at 1.20 and goes up based on margin, profitability, and
feasibility (from R&D perspective)

### Nutrite Products ###
Nutrites = food-based beauty care products, not yet in market

Demand for nutrites will be completely independent of that of clinites.
